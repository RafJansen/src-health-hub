1. Raw text with marked causes and effects
Biodiversity underpins ecosystem functioning and the provision of goods and services that are essential to human health and well-being (C). Ecosystems, including our food production systems, depend on a whole host of organisms: primary producers, herbivores, carnivores, decomposers, pollinators, pathogens, natural enemies of pests. Services provided by ecosystems include food, clean air and both the quantity and quality of fresh water, medicines, spiritual and cultural values, climate regulation, pest and disease regulation, and disaster risk reduction (E). Biodiversity is a key environmental determinant of human health (C); the conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity can benefit human health by maintaining ecosystem services (E) and by maintaining options for the future.

2. Extracted causes and effects
C: biodiversity underpins ecosystem functioning -> E: provision of goods and services essential to human health and well-being
C: biodiversity as a key environmental determinant -> E: benefits human health by maintaining ecosystem services



## API Response for Article ID 4:

1. Raw text with marked causes and effects
The links between biodiversity and health are manifested at various spatial and temporal scales. At a planetary scale, ecosystems and biodiversity play a critical role in determining the state of the Earth System (C), regulating its material and energy flows and its responses to abrupt and gradual change (E). At a more intimate level, the human microbiota â€“ the symbiotic microbial communities present on our gut, skin, respiratory and urino-genital tracts (C), contribute to our nutrition (E), can help regulate our immune system (E), and prevent infections (E).

2. Extracted causes and effects
C: ecosystems and biodiversity -> E: regulate material and energy flows and responses to change
C: human microbiota -> E: contribute to nutrition
C: human microbiota -> E: help regulate immune system
C: human microbiota -> E: prevent infections



## API Response for Article ID 5:

1. Raw text with marked causes and effects
Biodiversity and human health, and the respective policies and activities, are interlinked in various ways. First, biodiversity gives rise to health benefits (E). For example, the variety of species and genotypes (C) provide nutrients and medicines (E). Biodiversity also underpins ecosystem functioning (C) which provides services such as water and air purification, pest and disease control and pollination (E). However, it can also be a source of pathogens (C) leading to negative health outcomes (E). A second type of interaction arises from drivers of change that affect both biodiversity and health in parallel. For example, air and water pollution can lead to biodiversity loss and have direct impacts on health. A third type of interaction arises from the impacts of health sector interventions on biodiversity and of biodiversity-related interventions on human health. For example, the use of pharmaceuticals may lead to the release of active ingredients in the environment and damage species and ecosystems, which in turn may have negative knock-on effects on human health. Protected areas or hunting bans could deny access of local communities to bushmeat and other wild sources of food and medicines with negative impacts on health. Positive interactions of this type are also possible; for example, the establishment of protected areas (C) may protect water supplies (E) with positive health benefits (E).

2. Extracted causes and effects
C: variety of species and genotypes -> E: provide nutrients and medicines
C: biodiversity underpinning ecosystem functioning -> E: provides services such as water and air purification, pest and disease control, and pollination
C: biodiversity as a source of pathogens -> E: negative health outcomes
C: establishment of protected areas -> E: protect water supplies with positive health benefits
