Preface

Preface by the Chair of the Rockefeller-Lancet Commission on 
Planetary Health
The last 50 years have seen unprecedented improvements in human health, as measured by most 
conventional metrics. This human flourishing has, however, been at the cost of extensive degradation 
to the Earth’s ecological and biogeochemical systems. The impacts of transformations to these 
systems; including accelerating climatic disruption, land degradation, growing water scarcity, fisheries 
degradation, pollution, and biodiversity loss; have already begun to negatively impact human health. 
Left unchecked these changes threaten to reverse the global health gains of the last several decades 
and will likely become the dominant threat to health over the next century. But there is also much 
cause for hope. The interconnected nature of people and the planet mean that solutions that benefit 
both the biosphere and human health lie within reach. Improving the evidence base of links between 
environment and health, identifying and communicating examples of co-benefits and building inter-
disciplinary relationships across research themes are key challenges which must be addressed, to help 
build a post-2015 agenda where a healthy biosphere is recognised as a precondition for human health 
and prosperity.

In response to these challenges, The Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet, have formed a Commission 
to review the scientific basis for linking human health to the underlying integrity of Earth’s natural 
systems (The Commission on Planetary Health) and set out recommendations for action to the health 
community and policymakers working in sectors that influence health, development and the biosphere. 
The Commission has been underway since July 2014, and will conclude its work through the publication 
of a peer-reviewed Commission Report in The Lancet in July 2015.

The Commission welcomes this timely and important State of Knowledge Review from the Convention 
on Biological Diversity and the World Health Organization. The greatest challenge to protecting 
Planetary Health over the coming century is to develop the capability of human civilisations, to interpret, 
understand, and respond to the risks that we ourselves have created and this Review is a major advance 
in our understanding of these risks and the benefits of actions to reduce them.

¹ The right to health is established as a fundamental right of every human being in Article 1 of the World Health Organization 
Constitution (http://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf). This was the first international instrument to 
enshrine the “right to health” as the “enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health”, also reflected in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. The right to health is understood as an inclusive right that extends beyond health 
care to include the underlying determinants of health, such as access to water and food, essential medicines, etc.

² The World Health Organization and the Convention on Biological Diversity have been cooperating to promote greater 
awareness about, and action on, the interlinkages between human health and biodiversity by convening experts from relevant 
organizations, joint publications and organizing regional capacity-building workshops for experts from the biodiversity 
and health sectors in the Americas and Africa (Romanelli et al. 2014). The Conference of the Parties to the Convention on 
Biological Diversity has adopted a number of decisions in this regard (CBD 2010, 2012, 2014).

Box 1: Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020

The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and its twenty Aichi Targets provide an agreed 
overarching framework for action on biodiversity, and a foundation for sustainable development 
for all stakeholders, including agencies across the United Nations (UN) system. The Strategic Plan 
was adopted at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity and has been recognized or supported by the governing bodies of other biodiversity-related 
conventions, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the Convention 
on Wetlands of International Importance, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food 
and Agriculture, the World Heritage Convention, as well as the UN General Assembly.

Governments at Rio 20 a rmed the importance of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 
and achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, emphasizing the role that the Strategic Plan plays for the 
UN system, the international community and civil society worldwide to achieve the world we want. It 
is primarily implemented by countries through national biodiversity strategies and action plans, with 
Parties encouraged to set their own national targets within the framework of the Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets. The UN General Assembly has encouraged Parties and all stakeholders, institutions and 
organizations concerned to consider the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets in the elaboration of the post-2015 UN Development Agenda, taking into account 
the three dimensions of sustainable development.

The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 includes a vision for 2050, ve strategic goals and 
twenty Aichi Biodiversity Targets, mostly to be achieved by 2020. The 2050 Vision stresses the role

For example, di erent species (as well as crop varieties and livestock breeds) provide nutrients and

can lead to biodiversity loss and have direct impacts on health. Deforestation (or other land-use change or 
ecosystem disturbance) can lead to loss of species and habitats, and also increased disease risk for humans. 
Conversely, moderated meat consumption can reduce the pressures on biodiversity (less land-use change; 
lower greenhouse gas emissions) and also have health bene ts for individuals. In addition to the parallel

environment and damage species and ecosystems. Again, these may have negative knock-on e ects on human 
health. On the other hand, protected areas or hunting bans could deny access of local communities to bushmeat 
and other wild foods, with negative nutritional impacts. Positive interactions of this type are also possible. For 
example, establishment of protected areas may protect water supplies, with positive health bene ts.

of rivers increase flood flow volumes, sometimes increasing flood peaks, (5) some wetlands increase river flows during the 
dry season, and (6) some wetlands, such as floodplain wetlands hydrologically connected to aquifers, recharge groundwater 
when flooded. Mangrove wetlands are also effective in removing heavy metals from water (Marchand et al. 2012).

³ Increased species diversity can reduce disease risk in some cases by regulating the abundance of an important host species 
(Rudolf & Antonovics 2005), or by redistributing vector meals in the case of vector-borne diseases (Van Buskirk and Ostfeld 
1995; Norman et al. 1999; LoGiudice et al. 2003). In practice, transmission reduction can occur when adding species reduces 
pathogen load or the pathogen’s titre (i.e. the concentration of an antibody, as determined by finding the highest dilution 
at which it is still able to cause agglutination of the antigen) within the host (Keesing et al. 2006). For a more thorough 
review on the role of biodiversity in disease emergence, see the chapter on infectious diseases in this volume.

Box 1. The Catskills: an ecosystem service for over 10 million people

The Catskills mountains were named a forest reserve in 1885 and are one of several important 
examples of the fact that cost–e ective biodiversity and health co-bene ts are achievable. In the 
three decades that followed the creation of the forest reserve, the high value of the life-supporting 
services provided by the mountains became apparent; rather than investing large sums of money 
on ltering water supplies, the state of New ork invested in creating reservoirs in the Catskills park, 
beginning with the Ashokan Reservoir in 1898. Today, the New ork watershed provides the largest 
un ltered water supply in the United States and provides an estimated 1.3 billion gallons of drinking 
water to over 10 million residents daily. To this day, water quality standards mandated by the United 
States (US) Environmental Protection Agency have been met without the need for water ltration 
services, whose estimated costs would have run into billions of US dollars. It has been estimated that 
New ork city avoided 6–8 billion in expenses over a 10 year period, by protecting its watersheds.

More recently, the important role of the Catskills as a breeding site for sh has also been recognized. 
The Catskill Center for Conservation and Development was founded in 1969, and has been 
advocating for the park since. To this day, the Catskills provide much of New ork State s highest-
quality drinking water as well as a relaxing recreational site for tourists and locals alike. E orts to ban 
high-volume hydraulic fracturing for shale oil in the surrounding areas stem from concerns about its 
impact on water quality. There are also serious concerns about the potential of drought related to 
climate change having a signi cant impact on this vital ecosystem service.

Box 2. Case study: Water consumption and cotton production

Cotton is a particularly important global crop and the most important natural bre used in textile 
industries worldwide, accounting for 40% of textile production, but it is also a major consumer of 
water: over half of all cotton production is dependent on heavy irrigation (Soth et al 1999; Chapagain 
2006). In the period 1960–2000, an environmental disaster unfolded as the Aral Sea in Central 
Asia lost approximately 60% of its area and 80% of its volume (Glantz 1998; Pereira et al. 2002) 
as a result of the annual withdrawal of water from its main feeder rivers, the Amu Darya and the Syr 
Darya, for cotton agriculture in the desert (Cosgrove and Rijsberman 2014). This depletion of water 
a ected local sheries and livelihoods (Micklin 2007), as well as water quality both from harvesting 
and processing (Bednar et al. 2002; Chapagain et al. 2006). As cotton is a global commodity, its 
consumption takes place in areas remote from its growth. One study concluded that about 84% of 
the “water footprint” of cotton consumption in Europe is located outside the continent, with “major 
impacts in India and Uzbekistan” (Chapagain et al. 2006).  E orts to improve the production of cotton 
have focused on the development of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, which reduces 
insecticide use (Cattaneo et al. 2006), as well as improvements in water e ciency through drip 
irrigation furrow, and other e orts to reduce the negative environmental and human health impacts. 
Despite these e orts, cotton production, itself a source of agricultural biodiversity reduction, remains 
a major consumer of global freshwater with a pronounced impact on freshwater biodiversity.

* Whereas the term “ecological footprint” denotes the area (ha) needed to sustain a population, the “water footprint” rep-
resents the water volume (cubic metres per year) required, including dilution water necessary to restore polluted water to 
internationally agreed water quality standards.

Box 3. Ecosystem disturbance and waterborne disease: the case of schistosomiasis

While ecosystems can act as disease reservoirs, there is abundant scienti c literature to support 
the claim that these cannot be viewed in isolation from the human activity that alters them. 
Schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease that a ects some 200 million people worldwide. It can 
cause grave damage to internal tissues, including the liver, intestines and bladder, and has been 
found to undermine growth and development in children.

While schistosomiasis has been closely related to ecosystem disruption and the unsustainable use of 
biological resources, it is also sustained in a setting of poverty. A systematic review of schistosomiasis 
and water resource development carried out by Steinmann et al. (2006) estimated that among 
200 million infected, an estimated 93% (192 million cases) occur in sub-Saharan Africa, including 
29 million in Nigeria, 19 million in the United Republic of Tanzania, and 15 million each in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana. Approximately 76% of the population in sub-Saharan 
Africa lives near rivers, lakes and other contaminated water bodies.

Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms (Schisotoma spp.), which spend a portion of their life-
cycle in some species of freshwater snails that act as intermediate hosts for the disease. People 
become infected with the parasitic worms when they enter contaminated waters and the parasitic 
worms leave their host to penetrate human skin, thus infecting the subject. In Lake Malawi, it was 
found that over shing caused an increase in abundance of Bulinus nyassanus, a snail species that 
acts as the intermediate host of the schistosome parasite.

¹⁴ See MDG 7 (Ensure environmental sustainability) Targets 9, 10, 11; MDG 4 (Reduce child mortality) Target 5; MDG 6 
(Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases) Target 8.

¹⁵ It is estimated that 1.1 billion people did not have access to safe drinking water and 2.4 billion lacked access to improved 
sanitation when these goals and targets were first adopted.

¹⁶ When the MDGs were first adopted, approximately 3.1% of annual deaths (1.7 million) and 3.7% of the annual health 
burden of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide (54.2 million) were attributed to unsafe water, sanitation and 
hygiene, all of them in low-income countries and 90% of them in children (WHO 2003). Major enteric pathogens in affected 
children include: rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae O1, and 
potentially enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp., V. cholerae 0139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile 
and Cryptosporidium parvum (Ashbolt 2004; WHO 2003a). 

¹⁷ By 2010, some 884 million people still did not use improved sources of drinking water (WHO 2010a). Additionally, 2.6 billion 
people did not use improved sanitation.

In Cameroon, schistosomiasis has been associated with an increase in deforestation. The increase in 
the amount of sunlight penetration, altered water rates and ow levels, and increase in vegetation 
growth caused by deforestation altered the ecology of freshwater snail populations in the area. 
Bulinus truncatus, a competent host for the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium (responsible for 
an estimated two thirds of all schistosoma infections in sub-Saharan Africa and an important cause of 
severe urinary tract disease), displaced another type of freshwater snail, Bulinus forskalii, which itself 
hosted a non-pathogenic schistosome but was less able to thrive in cleared habitat.

In Kenya, the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in children rose to a staggering 70% ten years 
after the start of the Hola irrigation project (prevalence was 0% prior to the start of the project). The 
irrigation project led to the introduction of a new snail vector well suited to the altered environment. 
The prevalence of schistosomiasis further increased to 90% by 1982. (Malaria is another disease that 
has been closely associated with the construction of dams and irrigation projects.)

In the Nile Delta of Egypt, dam construction in 1965 also led to an increase in schistosomiasis by 
increasing the habitat for Bulinus truncates, leading to an increase of almost 20% in the 1980s from 
6% prior to dam construction. The increase in disease prevalence was even greater in other parts of 
the country.

² This altered energy use consequently leads to altered pollutant emissions from power plants used to produce the energy

from numerous sources (e.g. cars, power plants), but can also lead to reduced formation of O3 ,as O3 formation tends to 
increase with increasing air temperatures. 

³ Trees also directly affect particulate matter in the atmosphere by intercepting particles, emitting particles (e.g. pollen) and 
resuspending particles captured on the plant surface. Some particles can be absorbed into the tree, though most intercepted 
particles are retained on the plant surface. Many of the particles that are intercepted are eventually resuspended back to the 
atmosphere, washed off by rain, or dropped to the ground with leaf and twig fall. During dry periods, particles are constantly 
intercepted and resuspended, in part, dependent upon wind speed. During precipitation, particles can be washed off and 
either dissolved or transferred to the soil. Consequently, vegetation is only a temporary retention site for many atmospheric 
particles, though the removal of gaseous pollutants is more permanent as the gases are often absorbed and transformed 
within the leaf interior.

Box 1. Risks to animal genetic resources

A total of 7616 livestock breeds from 180 countries are mentioned in the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) s Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. It 
has been estimated that 30% of these are at risk of extinction. In contrast to crops plants where 
signi cant populations of potentially valuable crop relatives exist in the wild, The state of the world’s 
animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (FAO 2007) notes that “with the exception of the 
wild boar (Sus scrofa), the ancestors and wild relatives of major livestock species are either extinct 
or highly endangered as a result of hunting, changes to their habitats, and in the case of the wild red 
jungle fowl, intensive cross-breeding with the domestic counterpart. Thus, domestic livestock are the 
depositories of the now largely vanished diversity” (FAO 2007:6).

Box 2. Aquatic agroecosystems and human health

Aquatic agroecosystems, such as sh–rice systems of South and South-East Asia, contain a rich 
diversity of edible species. For many rural populations living in these areas, rice and sh are the 
main dietary staple. Aquatic animals are often the most important source of animal protein and are 
essential during times of rice shortages, providing essential nutrients that may otherwise not be 
adequate (Halwart 2006). Thus, wild and gathered foods from aquatic habitats provide important 
diversity, nutrition and food security. Recent studies on the utilization of aquatic biodiversity from 
rice-based ecosystems during one season only in Cambodia, China, Laos and Viet Nam found that 
145 species of sh, 11 species of crustaceans, 15 species of molluscs, 13 species of reptiles, 11 
species of amphibians, 11 species of insects and 37 species of plants were caught or collected 
(Halwart 2013; Halwart 2006; Halwart and Bartley 2005).

Bangladesh contains a great variety of inland water bodies, including beels, ponds, rivers, canals, 
ditches and rice paddy elds, which contain more than 267 freshwater sh species (Rahman 1989). 
In particular, small indigenous sh species (Parambassis baculis, Parambassis ranga, Rohtee cotio, 
Esomus danricus, Corica soborna, Chanda nama, Amblypharyngodon mola, Channa punctatus, Puntius 
ssp.) are a rich source of highly bioavailable nutrients, animal protein and some, with a high fat 
content, contain bene cial polyunsaturated fatty acids. Indigenous sh species, such as darkina 
(Esomus danricus), have a high iron, zinc and vitamin A content (Thilsted 2013; see also the chapter 
on nutrition).

Integrated aquatic agroecosystems demonstrate the many bene cial interactions between the 
di erent elements of biodiversity that enhance food production and the ecosystem services that 
support it while signi cantly increasing agricultural biodiversity and reducing production risks. 
Rice plants contribute to improved water quality and ensure temperatures for optimum prawn and 

sh production. Plants provide habitat and shelter for sh, reducing the risk of predation. Foraging 
on aquatic sediments, including pests and weeds, and the consumption of phytoplankton by sh 
enhances nutrient exchange between water and soil, and reduces the need for pesticides and 
fertilizers. Small indigenous sh species also tend to be preferred by farming households and 
constitute an important source of minerals, micronutrients and vitamins (Bunting and Ahmed 2014).

Box 3. Soil health and agricultural biodiversity

The importance of agricultural biodiversity in supporting soil health and associated regulating and 
supporting ecosystem services has been reviewed by Swift et al. (2004). The importance of diversity 
of soil biota and of the maintenance of all components of the soil food web, and of diversity within 
di erent levels has been described by Beed et al. (2011), Gliessman (2007) and M der et al. (2002). 
However, the amount of diversity that is needed or desirable is the subject of some debate and some 
authors have argued that, in functional terms, saturation is reached at fairly low levels of species 
diversity. There is growing evidence that natural and less intensive agricultural production systems 
have higher levels of diversity than those under intensive agriculture and that higher levels of 
diversity are associated with improved delivery of key ecosystem services. Swift et al. (2004) have 
noted the importance of maintaining total system diversity and of practices, such as conservation 
agriculture, and mulching, which ensure higher diversity levels in the soil.

marginal agricultural lands (Grau et al. 2004), and and green spaces, enlarging fields and expanding 

land under permanent cultivation (Stoate et al. 

As global incomes increase, diets increasingly shift from the protein derived from plant products 
to increased consumption of meat, dairy and eggs, adding pressure on farming systems to increase 
livestock production (Tilman et al. 2011). Global meat production is projected to more than double 
from 229 million tonnes in 1999/2001 to 465 million tonnes in 2050, while milk output is set to 
climb from 580 to 1043 million tonnes (FAO 2006). Already livestock production uses 30% of the 
earth s entire land surface, mostly permanent pasture but also including 33% of the global arable 
land used to produce feed for livestock (FAO 2006; Cassidy et al. 2013). While livestock makes an 
important contribution to food security, its increased consumption is also a contributing factor to the 
increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and can have negative impacts on biodiversity (as 
discussed in the chapter on nutrition in this volume).

Livestock feed crops (maize, soya) in low-diversity and high-intensity cultivation systems are a very 
ine cient use of resources and crop calories. For every kilogram of beef produced, 1 kg of feed is 
needed (USDA 2002). At present, 36% of calories produced by cropping systems is used for animal 
feed of which only 12% are ultimately used for human consumption (Cassidy et al. 2013). It has 
been estimated that if these calories were consumed by people directly, the current global food 
production system could feed an additional 4 billion (Cassidy et al. 2013), meeting our estimated 
population growth forecasts for 2050.

The conversion of land for pasture is a major driver of deforestation. For example, in Latin America, 
some 70% of former Amazonian forest has been turned over to grazing (FAO 2006). Widespread 
overgrazing disturbs water cycles, reducing replenishment of above-and below-ground water 
resources. Beyond land conversion, the livestock sector can also be deleterious to increasingly scarce 
water resources with negative implications for human health (McMichael et al. 2007). Animal wastes 
antibiotics and hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and the pesticides used to spray feed 
crops contribute substantially to water pollution, eutrophication and the degeneration of coral reefs, 
while also posing health risks, such as antibiotic resistance (FAO 2006; Horrigan et al. 2002). The use 
of these products not only a ects biodiversity but also has health consequences, for example, by 
a ecting drinking water quality, increasing the risks for several types of cancer, undermining local 

sheries – another important source of dietary protein – and contributing to endocrine disruption 
and reproductive dysfunction (Horrigan et al. 2002; see also chapter on freshwater in this volume).

Box 5. Case study: biofuels

Crops for industrial use, including biofuels, make up 9% of crops by mass, 9% by calorie content, 
and 7% of total plant protein production, diverting a considerable quantity of food away from 
human consumption (Cassidy et al. 2013). In 2000, biofuel production alone represented 3% of 
crop production and is estimated to have increased more than 450% (in terms of litres produced) 
between the year 2000 and 2010 (WWI 2009), suggesting that increasing areas of land are being 
dedicated to the production of intensively managed corn, vegetable oils and sugarcane (Cassidy 
et al. 2013). Based on biofuel statistics from 2010, ethanol production from maize in the United 
States and from sugarcane in Brazil alone now represents 6% of global crop production by mass 
and 4% of calorie production (FAPRI 2011). Although biofuels are meant to help reduce the 
dependence on carbon-dense energy sources and reduce carbon emissions to mitigate climate 
change, the production of food crops for biofuels can have additional negative impacts on human 
health associated with (i) intense production techniques (i.e. air quality from forest burning, high 
chemical use and contamination of waterways) and (ii) diversion of crop calories away from the food 
production system. In addition to biofuels, signi cant portions of cultivated land are dedicated to the 
production of bres, in particular cotton, as described in the chapter on freshwater. 

Box 6. Case study: vegetable oils

Vegetable oils are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural sectors (Clay 2004), and more 
palm oil is produced than any other vegetable oil (Carter et al. 2007). A native of West Africa, oil palm 
(Elaeis guineensis) is grown across more than 13.5 million ha of tropical, high-rainfall, low-lying areas, 
a zone naturally occupied by moist tropical forest, the most biologically diverse terrestrial ecosystem 
on earth (Corley and Tinker 2003, MEA 2005). Palm oil has some of the world s largest plantations, 
sometimes exceeding 20000 ha (Donald 2004), cut out of the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, 
Malaysia and increasingly in Latin America. This has resulted in extensive clearing and burning 
of carbon-rich forests and peat lands, contributing to biodiversity loss, poor air quality a ecting 
respiratory health particularly in South-East Asia, and adding CO2 to the atmosphere (Clay 2004). 
Examination of palm oil cultivation in contrast to shaded co ee, pasture and natural forest found 
that palm plantations supported extremely low levels of birds, lizards, beetles and ant communities 
(Power and Flecker 1998; Chung et al. 2000; Glor et al. 2001).

Per unit area, palm oil is the highest-yielding vegetable oil crop; the current global production of oil 
palm fruit is estimated at 97.7 million tons, produced from 10.7 million ha; production is increasing 
by 9% every year (Donald 2004). Palm oil now makes up about 21% of the world s production of 
edible oils and fats, second only to soybean oil. The oil is used in the manufacture of cooking oil, 
margarine, soap and cosmetics, and it has industrial uses. As a substitute for diesel, palm oil is less 
suitable than other vegetable oils owing to its high viscosity, lower energy density and high ash 
point (Agrawal 2007). However, oil palm gives high yields at low prices, and hence is likely to be 
important in meeting biofuel demand (Carter et al. 2007; Koh 2007).

production.

• Mobilize the resources needed to increase productivity, including research, and the review, 
approval and adoption of biotechnology and other new technologies.

• Enable all farmers, particularly women and smallholder farmers from countries most vulnerable to 
climate change, to adapt to, and mitigate the impact of, climate change.

• Support national, regional and international programmes that contribute to improved food safety

Box 9. Agro-ecological resilience after Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch hit Central America, causing damage worth at least US  6.7 billion. 
Over 10000 people died and 3 million were displaced or left homeless. In Nicaragua, a comparative 
study was carried out using participatory approaches, which involved farmers and local NGOs, 
on the levels of resistance to the hurricane of “sustainable” farms using a variety of sustainable 
land management practices, and neighbouring “conventional” farms that lacked those practices. 
On average, agro-ecological plots on sustainable farms had more topsoil, higher eld moisture, 
less erosion and lower economic losses after the hurricane than the plots on conventional farms. 
The di erences in favour of agro-ecological plots tended to increase with increasing levels of 
storm intensity, increasing slope and years under agro-ecological practices, though the patterns of 
resistance suggested complex interactions and thresholds.

Box 1. Food composition and food consumption indicators for biodiversity

Speci c indicators for biodiversity are needed to understand, quantify, and monitor the role of 
biodiversity in human diets, and the impact of biodiversity-related nutrition interventions and 
initiatives. Among relevant activities under the Cross-cutting Initiative and within the framework of 
the Biodiversity Indicator Partnership, FAO, INFOODS and Bioversity International convened a series of 
meetings and expert consultations to propose, develop and monitor nutrition indicators for biodiversity.

During two technical meetings, two nutrition indicators were developed: Indicator 1 on food 
composition (FAO, 2008) and Indicator 2 on food consumption (FAO 2010).

Indicator 1 relates to the availability of compositional data, i.e. nutrients, bioactive non-nutrients, and 
contaminants, on foods meeting the criteria of biodiversity. The criteria include food items reported 
at the taxonomic level below the species level, along with wild, neglected and underutilized species. 
In 2008, the baseline report counted 5519 foods for Indicator 1. In subsequent years, between 835 
and 5186 foods were added annually (FAO/INFOODS 2013). Researchers worldwide are submitting 
their data to the FAO/INFOODS Food Composition Database for Biodiversity (FAO/INFOODS 2013a), 
which serves as an international repository of analytical data on biodiversity of su cient quality. 
These data are freely available, widely disseminated, and frequently cited.

Indicator 2 refers to a count of the number of biodiverse foods reported in food consumption or 
similar surveys (FAO 2010). In 2009, the baseline report counted 3,119 foods. In the two reporting 
periods that followed, 1,827 and 1,375 foods were added. A secondary survey indicator was 
developed as a count of the number of food consumption and similar surveys taking biodiversity into 
consideration in their design and/or reporting, with at least one reported food meeting the criteria for 
Indicator 2 (FAO/INFOODS 2013).

These indicators have proven useful in stimulating the collection and dissemination of biodiversity 
data for food composition and consumption. They are also advocacy tools to policy-makers and 
programme managers for e ectively raising awareness of the importance of biodiversity for nutrition 
and providing documentation of the ever-increasing knowledge of biodiversity and human nutrition.

In Bangladesh, a sh chutney was developed to increase the contribution of essential nutrients 
from an animal-source food in the rst 1000 days of life, to supplement the diet of pregnant and 
breastfeeding poor, rural women in Bangladesh, and promote growth and development in infants 
and young children. The chutney is based on a traditional “achar” or pickle recipe which is commonly 
served with boiled rice and curry vegetables. The chutney contains 37% dried small sh, 15% oil, 
37% onion, 7% garlic and 4% chili. The recommended serving is one heaped tablespoon of sh 
chutney (equal to 30 g containing 60 g of raw sh), to be eaten with the main meal. The sh chutney 
is well-liked by women and is a good source of micronutrients such as iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin 
B12, as well as animal protein and essential fatty acids. The particular relevance of the latter for 
cognition in the rst 1000 days is especially important. In addition, the sh itself enhances the 
bioavailability of minerals from the plant-source foods (rice and vegetables) in the meal.

The sh chutney, produced by a women s group, is presently being distributed to 150 pregnant and 
lactating rural women in Sunamganj, north-eastern Bangladesh, through a project aimed at improving 
the livelihoods of poor rural households. The small sh used is sourced from the wetlands and sun-
dried by local women. Assistance, training and supervision have been provided to ensure safe and 
hygienic conditions for processing, storage and transportation. Women receiving the sh chutney 
report producing “a lot of milk” and their children “getting more milk, being satis ed and growing 
well”. Partners have shown interest in using the product in national food programmes, emergency 
response food rations, school feeding programmes and for sale in local and urban outlets.

This project demonstrates that food processing is important for highly perishable products such as 
sh, fruit or vegetables. They may increase food safety, market opportunities, the geographical and 

temporal usage, as well as the livelihood of small-scale producers.

Box 3. Pollinator declines, human nutrition and health

Declines in animal pollinators are a subset of biodiversity loss that have been well documented 
around the globe (Vanbergen 2013; Burke et al. 2013; Potts et al. 2013). Over the past decade, the 
human health implications of these declines have received increasing attention. Pollinators are 
estimated to be responsible for roughly one third of human caloric intake (Kleine et al. 2007) as well 
as up to 40% of the global nutrient supply (Eilers et al. 2011). Regions where pollinators contribute 
most heavily to nutrient production may also be those where human populations are su ering 
from the largest burdens of micronutrient de ciency diseases (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2014). In the 

rst published analysis of human vulnerability to pollinator declines based on an evaluation of 
population-level dietary patterns, Ellis et al. (2015) found that as much as 56% of a population could 
be placed at new risk of vitamin A de ciency as a result of the loss of animal pollinators.

Perhaps even more signi cant in terms of global health is the potential impact of pollinator declines 
on the yields of food groups whose intakes, as a whole, have recently been shown to have very large 
impacts on the global burden of disease. If pollinators  work would need to be done manually by 
mankind, additional economic costs would appear for a work less e ciently performed. The recent 
assessment of the global burden of disease has emphasized a global pandemic of NCDs including 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and diet-related cancers (Lim et al. 2010). Because their intakes 
reduce the risk of these diseases, low intakes of fruit, nuts and seeds, and vegetables have been 
shown to rank fourth, twelfth, and seventeenth on the list of global risk factors for burden of disease. 

ields of each of these food groups are highly pollinator dependent. A recent analysis involving a 
member of our authorship group is currently in press at the Lancet and suggests very large global 
burdens of disease would result from reduced intake of these food groups as a consequence of 
animal pollinator declines. This analysis also emphasizes that large numbers of people around 
the world would additionally be placed at risk for folate and vitamin A de ciency, and many who 
are already de cient would become more de cient. Thus, animal pollinator declines could lead to 
substantial new disease burdens from both micronutrient de ciencies and chronic diseases.

Box 4: Indigenous fruit trees: the African baobab

Forests and their non-timber forest products (NTFPs), either through direct or indirect provisioning for 
human nutrition, can contribute to food security, particularly in developing countries. The potential 
of indigenous food, is mostly derived from wild and underutilized cultivated species, has largely 
remained untapped due to scant information on the nutritive and economic value of these foods. 
For example, combining di erent indigenous fruit tree species in agroforestry systems based on the 
seasonal calendar of fruit availability could result in a year-round supply of key nutrients (Vinceti 
et al. 2013; amnadass et al. 2013; Kehlenbeck et al. 2013a, b; amnadass et al. 2011). A study by 
Kehlenbeck et al. (2013a) in sub-Saharan Africa shows that consuming 40–100 g of berries from 
Grewia tenax (Forrsk.) Fiori could supply almost 100% of the daily iron requirements for a child 
under 8 years of age. In addition to micronutrients, the high sugar content of fruits such as tamarind 
(Tamarindus indica L) and baobab (Adansonia digitata L) make them important sources of energy. The 
fruits of Dacryodes edulis (G. Don) H. . Lam, and the seeds of Irvingia gabonensis (Aubrey-Lecomte ex 
O Rorke) Baill., Sclerocarya ca ra Sond. and Ricinodendron rautanenii Schinz have a higher fat content 
than peanuts (Vinceti et al. 2013; ohnson et al. 2013).

The occurrence and distribution of the African baobab (Adansonia digitata) in drier habitats of Africa, 
commonly found in savanna, scrubland and semi-desert, has great potential to support communities 
in more vulnerable dryland ecosystems and in the face of climate variability. The baobab is a 
majestic tree in the landscape but it is not only its physical presence that exhibits diversity within 

⁴ For example, Shackleton et al. (1998) reported that the majority of households in rural northeast South Africa 
dried one or more wild vegetable species and between 20% and 50% dried wild fruits for use in the off season. 
The role of traditional knowledge associated with wild foods is also important in helping communities cope 
with lean periods as well as supporting the conservation of wild foods (Sujarwo et al. 2014; Pardo-de-Santayana 
and Macia 2015).

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 109



and between its trees but also the high nutritional value of its fruits. The most important food from 
baobab is the fruit pulp, which is rich in vitamins and minerals. It can provide far higher amounts of 
vitamin C, calcium and iron than more common tropical fruits such as mango and orange (Kehlenbeck 
et al. 2013a). However, there is a large variability in the levels of vitamin C in fruits of di erent 
individual baobab trees – from 126 to 509 mg per 100 g edible portion (Stadlmayr et al. 2013) – but 
even the lowest gure identi ed is far higher than in many other fruits. In addition to the fruit pulp, 
baobab also produces leaves that are used as nutritious vegetables and edible seeds, from which oil 
for consumption and cosmetic purposes are produced (Caluwe et al. 2010).

The potential of baobab for nutrition and income generation is a good example of a new product with 
high potential in European market, given the acceptance of baobab as a novel food in 2008. Due to 
its high nutrition potential and demand in consumer markets, research is ongoing in East Africa by the 
World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) to identify populations of baobab, distribution across landscapes, 
variation in genetic and morphological characteristics, and the diversity of nutritional content within 
and between wild populations. Information on nutrient content may facilitate the selection of priority 
fruit tree species for domestication programmes aiming at improving food and nutrition security and 
for income generation.

While baobab is one example, there are hundreds of other wild food trees in Africa with similar 
importance for food and nutrition security. Developing and disseminating nutrient-sensitive 
processing techniques for indigenous fruits can further contribute to rural livelihoods through 
diversi cation of income-generating activities and by extending the shelf-life and availability of tree-
based food products for consumption during o -seasons. Markets need to be developed for these 
new products, and processors linked to domestic and international markets to further improve value 
chain opportunities. However, the abundance of indigenous fruit trees is said to be decreasing in 
many parts of sub-Saharan Africa due to changes in ecosystem equilibrium and loss of biodiversity 
as a result of changes in land use, increasing urbanization and climatic shocks, among others. All of 
these result in shifts in species distribution, altered pest and disease occurrences, and possibly a 
lack of pollinators (see Box 3) for su cient fruit tree diversity and occurrence. Domestication and 
increased cultivation of the most important indigenous fruit tree species may help to both conserve 
biodiversity and provide rural communities with better livelihood options.

Results from the Philippine National Nutrition survey suggests that the nation s diet is consistent with 
the world phenomenon of diet simpli cation, that is, less complex and high-energy diets (Frison et al. 
2010). Food consumption data from 1978 to 2003 show the dietary pattern of Filipinos comprised 
rice, sh and vegetables. Changes in proportions of these food items, however, led to energy-dense 
density diets. Alongside this, there is a downward trend in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. 
Intake of starchy roots and tubers was halved from 1978 to 2003 (Pedro et al. 2006). On the other 
hand, there is increased consumption of meat, fats and oil, milk and sugars. This pattern, described as 
the nutrition transition, is also seen in other developing countries (Popkin 2001; Popkin et al. 2012). 
Recent diet diversity studies among Filipino children also re ect simpli ed diets as diet diversity 
score results are found to be below cut-o  points (Kennedy et al. 2007; Talavera et al. 2011). It 
should be noted that low scores indicate unsatisfactory nutrient adequacy (Hoddinott and ohannes 
2002; Ruel et al. 2004; Steyn et al. 2006). This lack of diet diversity is multi factorial (i.e. lack of 
purchasing power, unavailability in the markets, unfamiliarity with certain food items, lack of know-
how on to prepare/consume them). The nutrition transition, together with intensive agriculture and 
environmental pressures, is also attributed to reduction in dietary diversity and the accompanying 
loss in agricultural biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge (Gold and McBurney 2012).

The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) have witnessed signi cant dietary shifts from nutritious 
and diverse local staples to an increased dependence on imported, often unhealthy, foods in the 
past few decades, with up to 40% of all imports being food imports in 1986 (Englberger et al. 
2003d; 2011). In 2007, it was the second most obese country in the world, with pockets of vitamin 
A de ciency being among the highest worldwide, despite its abundance of local nutritionally rich 
local foods, including 133 varieties of breadfruit, 55 of banana, 171 of yam, 24 of giant swamp taro, 
nine varieties of tapioca and many varieties of pandanus in the state of Pohnpei alone (Englberger 
and ohnson 2013). There was little evidence of malnutrition, diabetes or hypertension before the 
1940s, with vitamin A de ciency not documented until 1998, indicating the likelihood that these 
were not problems . Englberger et al. (2003d) argue that it was not until a number of US initiatives 
started in the 1960s that issues of dependency on imported foods and dietary shifts began and, by 
1985, the national school feeding programme provided meals to 30% of its population based largely 
on food imports. While access to more diversi ed foods is not without its bene ts, an over reliance 
on imported foods threatens food security, sometimes leading to foods with lower nutritional 
quality, and can contribute to the chronic NCD burden (borne by an already overburdened national 
economy), and undermine traditional coping mechanisms and contingency planning developed by 
communities to deal with periods of food insecurity. Unfavourable food and trade policies often 
exacerbate these problems. Imported chicken and turkey tails are commonly eaten in FSM. These 
are fatty o -cuts, which are not marketed or consumed in their countries of origin because they are 
considered “health damaging products” and the practice of selling in the Paci c is seen as a form 
of “food inequality” considered by some as inappropriate “food dumping” (Hughes and Lawrence, 
2005; ackson, 1997). Such practices in the Paci c have prompted a range of trade-related food 
policy initiatives aimed at creating a healthier food environment (Thow et al. 2010; Snowdon and

Box 7. Slow Food and Torre Guaceto, Italy Marine Protected Area: a model to 
promote food cultures, health and sustainable use

Slow Food, a grassroots organization now spanning over 150 countries, is aimed at preventing 
the disappearance of local food cultures and traditions, counteracting the rise of “the fast life”, 
homogenizing food production, intensive industrial agricultural crops based on monoculture, 
and promoting interest in food s origins and cultural traditions at all levels of production and 
consumption (Petrini 2013; Schneider 2008; Kinley 2012). The selection of Slow Food products 
is based on an established set of criteria and a continuous exchange of information with local 
stakeholders to ensure social–cultural, environmental and economic sustainability.

Several approaches have been used to evaluate the sustainability and nutritional impact of these 
products. Recently, Pezzana et al. (2014) combined nutritional and multi-criteria sustainability to 
de ne the Life Cycle Assessment of Slow Food Presidia products. The study found “high levels of 
sustainability” and additional nutritional value of Slow Food products, and the value of multifactorial 
approaches in the analysis of the food–health–sustainability relationship (Pezzana et al. 2014).

Presidia products focus on key issues of interest for small-scale agriculture and farming, including 
the protection of mountain pastures and pastoral farming, defence of traditional landscapes 
and propagation of traditional seeds by communities, protection of small-scale onshore shing,

transparent labelling, ecologically sustainable packaging and the preservation of traditional artisanal 
knowledge linked to processing methods.

Examples include small-scale artisanal shing, which uses low-impact shing gear and regulates 
exploitation; it is part of the Mediterranean identity, employing half-a-million people in the region, 
promoting sustainable shing practices and allowing sh stocks to recover. Sustainable shing also 
implies the need to consider the conservation of marine species, production chains, ecological 
communities, and the human communities that support and rely on them for food, nutrition 
and income.

The 22 km2 marine protected area (MPA) of Torre Guaceto is a successful example of the bene ts of 
Slow Food for local communities. Initially established as a no shing MPA in 1991, its enforcement 
became e ective only in 2000 when the MPA authority and local shermen struck an agreement 
to implement a ve-year shing ban, allowing sh to repopulate and habitats to recover (Guidetti 
2010). Fishing gear and practices that caused the least damage to marine species and habitats 
were enforced. By the end of 2005, striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), large-scaled scorpion sh 
(Scorpaena scrofa) and other taxa also rebounded (Guidetti 2010). Once the reserve partially 
reopened, local shermen began to haul in catches more than twice the size of those outside the 
reserve (PISCO 2011).

Local MPA management authorities can also help shing communities to increase income 
opportunities where these are limited by seasonal variations or local preferences. For example, the 
Torre Guaceto MPA Municipality of Carovigno is far from large markets, some catch, including mullets 
(family Mugilidae), are not a local favourite year-round, making market value and income highly 
variable. Collaboration between the MPA Authority, the Slow Food Association and the Fishermen 
Cooperative of Carovigno in 2014 led to the production of mullet llets in extra virgin olive oil in 
glass jars, to stimulate quality and sustainable production of mullet processing for a broader market.

This o ers a good example of how local communities bene t from MPAs, which are critical for 
their protection, and how co-management schemes within protected areas may in turn deliver 
co-bene ts to ecosystems and local communities. These may reduce competition for shared shing 
resources, promote foods high in nutritional value, and support livelihoods and the conservation of 
food cultures. These initiatives are important to jointly increase awareness, sustainability and social 
acceptance of MPAs, and maximize bene ts for local populations.

Increasingly intensi ed human-caused landscape and behaviour changes have had signi cant 
consequences for human health over past decades. The emergence of Nipah virus provides a useful 
example of anthropogenic drivers of EIDs. In 1998, the Nipah virus outbreak emerged in humans 
in Malaysia. Flying fox bats (Pteropus spp.), the natural reservoir for Nipah virus, had rst infected 
domestic pigs. The vehicle for the bat–pig spillover is thought to be fruit contaminated with bat saliva 
from a fruit tree on the pig farm (Daszak et al. 2013). The dense pig housing conditions, respiratory 
shedding and high birth rate enabled “ampli cation” of viral transmission, allowing ease of 
transmission between pigs and to humans, leading to encephalitis and respiratory disease and over 
100 human deaths. The disease was also seen in Singapore and was estimated to cost US 550–650 
million in South East Asia, including costs incurred for control measures, the nancial impact to swine 
industry, and loss of employment (Newcomb et al. 2011). Nipah virus has also since emerged in 
Bangladesh and caused upwards of ten human outbreaks since 2001 (Luby et al. 2009a). The primary 
mode of the initial transmission to humans in these outbreaks is thought to be infection directly 
via ingestion of date palm sap that has been contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces (human–
human transmission following initial infection has also been reported in Bangladesh s Nipah virus 
outbreaks) (Luby et al 2009a; Luby et al. 2009b). Domestic animals may also consume the date palm 
sap contaminated by bats, thus potentially becoming infected and serving as an intermediate host 
for infection to humans or other species (Hughes et al. 2009). As a preventive solution, some date 
palm sap harvesters and researchers have tried placing bamboo skirts over sap collection buckets to 
protect the harvest from contamination (Luby et al. 2009a; Khan et al. 2012). This approach promotes 
both human livelihoods and the continued ecosystem services provided by bats such as seed 
dispersion and pollination (Luby et al. 2009b).

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 135



The situations by which Nipah virus has emerged and re-emerged demonstrate two key factors: 1) 
Human activity has driven Nipah virus emergence events. In Malaysia, deforestation and intensi ed 
agriculture enabled the movement and mixing of species and the resulting opportunity for pathogen 
transmission. In Bangladesh, human demand for natural resources through tapping into trees for sap 
enabled a new food source for bats, similarly providing pathogen mixing opportunities that can be 
detrimental to people and domestic animals (and potentially wildlife through con ict with humans 
given health and livelihood risks, though this has not been documented speci cally for Nipah virus). 
2) Ecosystem dynamics and disease ecology are complex. Land-use change and other changing 
ecological scenarios in one region may have unanticipated e ects in another region through species 
range adaptations and other factors. Climate change scenario models have suggested that increasing 
temperature may enable spread of the bat species that harbour Nipah virus (Daszak et al. 2013). 
Valuable information on risk factors for transmission from bats has been gained from bat ecology 
studies, such as considerations around seroprevalence for Nipah virus, bat mobility and colony 
connectivity, and temporal/seasonal aspects (Rahman et al. 2013). An ecosystem health perspective 
is needed to better understand and mitigate both health and biodiversity risks of potential changes 
to the environment.

Box 2: Ecological dynamics of infectious Disease: examples from South America

Changes in species biodiversity and composition a ect infectious disease transmission dynamics 
(Terborgh et al. 2001; Osteld & Holt; 2004, Rocha et al.; 2014). In the Brazilian Amazon, the 
transmission cycle for the human Chagas disease-causing parasite, Trypanosona cruzi, is related to 
changes in small mammal composition. Species competent in transmission have been favoured 
by transformation of native forest for homogeneous açaí plantations. The vector (Hemiptera sp.) is 
sheltered naturally in palm trees and is attracted to açaí plantations. As major wild mammals have 

136 Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health

been removed from these areas, the vector is attracted to human habitations and begins to feed 
on people and domestic animals living or working at açaí plantations, thus transposing the sylvatic 
cycle to human dwellings (Araújo et al. 2009; Varella et al. 2009; Xavier et al. 2012). Handling, 
extraction and preparation of coconut açaí pulp can allow for oral transmission (via contaminated 
food) of T. cruzi, as the vector can be crushed in açaí processing and remains in cold conditions until 
consumption, resulting in more than 100 new registered cases annually (Ministério da Saúde 2005; 
Roque et al. 2008; Nobrega et al. 2009). The costs of Chagas disease are high: 30% of infected 
people develop serious heart and digestive diseases. From 1975 to 1995 the Brazil Government 
invested US  420 million in control of Chagas disease, with a return of US  3 billion, or US  7.16 for 
each dollar invested (Akhavan 2000). Similar ecological dynamics have been observed for spotted 
fever, an acute infection caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, and transmitted by the bite of 
an infected tick. Incidence in Brazil has been increasing since 1996, although most cases are not 
diagnosed. Human mortality rate is 20%, and the most common vector is the star tick, Amblyomma 
cajennense, that typically infests chickens, horses, cattle, dogs and pigs, as well as wild animals such 
as capybaras, opossums, armadillos, snakes and wild canids. Changing species composition in small 
fragments and conservation units remaining around the Atlantic Forest have resulted in growing 
cases in south eastern Brazil, as also seen with Lyme disease in the United States (Meira et al. 2013).

Some disease relationships involve predator and prey, as predators can feed on prey that were 
already ill or disabled, removing them from a population and thus controlling disease. Other 
dynamics may also play important roles, as seen with the increase in rodent populations that are 
controlled by a combination of factors besides predator control (Mills 2006; Armién et al. 2009), 
as seems to be the scenario for hantavirus in the southern cone of South America. Several rodent 
species and viral genotypes build a parasite–host puzzle in which hantavirus infection is density-
dependent of rodent populations. Rodent populations are promoted by food supply, absence of 
predators, and even adaptability to synanthropic surroundings (Palma et al. 2012). In this region, 
habitat characteristics determine infection prevalence. In Paraguay and Uruguay, the highest 
prevalence of infected rodents are in disturbed areas such as planted elds, highway boundaries, 
planted forests, shrub-woods and near houses. In these cases, predators no longer exist and even 
with depleted populations of rodents, some population densities are high, increasing transmission 
risk. In Argentina, areas with highest prevalence are the preserved ones, demonstrating complexities 
and showing that knowledge of species and habitat characteristics are fundamental to the study of 
disease (Palma et al. 2012).

In the Amazon region the number of cases of human bat bites increased by nine times in areas of 
greatest deforestation between the years 2003 (852 cases) and 2004 (8,258 cases) (Ministério da 
Saúde 2006). In Pará, the Brazilian state with the highest deforestation rate, the number of cases 
jumped from 383 in 2003, to 7,640 in 2004, and more than 15,000 cases in 2005. These and other 
increases have been related to the loss of the wild native species that are the natural food sources 
for blood-sucking bats; humans, especially in mining areas, may serve as a substitute. Despite an 
increase in the number of bites, a decrease in the number of rabies cases was observed, likely 
indicating development of immunity in human populations through repeated exposure (Schneider et 
al. 2001).

Ecological studies in the Amazon correlate deforestation, hydroelectric industry, human occupations, 
and the presence of the mosquito vector Anopheles darlingi with increased malaria risk (Vasconcelos 
et al. 2006; Vittor et al. 2009). In regions with large hydropower plants, the rate of malaria is 278 

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 137



times higher than in forested areas (Afrane et al. 2006). In Brazil, according to 2011 data from the 
Ministry of Health, 99.5% of cases of disease transmission were in the Amazon region. In Amazonia, a 
complex set of factors relate disease transmission with environmental transformation. High mosquito 
density caused by deforestation, construction of power plants, roads, irrigation, dams and the large 
in ux of susceptible people (often living in houses without walls) inside or in forest edges helps 
increase circulation of aetiological agents linked to geographical and climatic factors such as high 
rates of rainfall, watershed amplitude and vegetation cover (Oliveira-Ferreira et al. 2010).

Genetic erosion may occur with loss of species, resulting in selection of receptive individuals for 
new pathogens or ones without ability to adapt to growing resistance to pathogens already present. 
This creates patches of high prevalence of infection and risk of spill-over to neighbouring regions, 
signifying the need to align conservation and health goals to maintain connectivity between natural 
areas to reduce anthropogenic driving forces for the emergence of diseases and biodiversity loss.

Disease dynamics are not limited to terrestrial settings. In marine environments, parasites tend to 
be generalists that seemingly use an adaptive strategy of dispersion in uid environments. Infective 
forms of parasites are more common on juvenile shes that are transmitted to others through the 
food chain by predation (Marcogliese 2002). In some cases, humans can replace natural de nitive 
hosts (e.g. cetaceans and pinnipeds) by eating raw sh. Thus, the reduction of sh stocks and the size 
of sh caught (Shin et al. 2005) may be risk factors for helminth transmission (Ferreira et al 1984). 
Oceans are typically a nal destination for e uent of domestic and industrial activities, and high 
concentrations of microbes in coastal waters indicate probable water and seafood contamination. 
Many bacteria and viruses are autochthonous to marine ecosystems (e.g. Aeromonadaceae and 
Vibrionaceae), so the use of enteric microbes as indicators of microbiological water quality is strongly 
limited, although many of them are clinically important to human health and biodiversity (Moura et 
al. 2012). Early eutrophication of aquatic systems bene ts parasites with gastropod and crustacean 
secondary hosts; additionally, release of waste into rivers and seas from human sewage and animal 
farms also increases black y populations, resulting in increased risk of transmission of onchocerciasis 
and economic losses to the cattle industry in areas of the Atlantic forest (Strieder et al. 2009).

Taken together, these examples of di erent infectious disease scenarios observed in South America 
highlight the complexity of disease ecology, and the impacts of rapidly changing environmental 
pressures. Ultimately, they demonstrate the importance of employing science-based proactive 
disease risk analyses and risk prevention and mitigation strategies.

The mechanisms vary among sites and extractive cross-species transmission of pathogens, which

wildlife, can have detrimental impacts on food

populations.

In addition to threats to livelihoods and food 
security from livestock die-offs, human health may 
be impacted. Livestock may serve as intermediate 
hosts for zoonotic disease transmission from 
wildlife to humans, in some cases serving an 
amplifying role. For example, Nipah virus, for 
which fruit bats are a natural reservoir, emerged 
in humans in Malaysia following conversion of 
forest to an intensive swine facility that enabled 
bat–swine contact, and subsequently transmission 
from pigs to humans (Karesh et al. 2012).

 Box 3: Sentinel surveillance opportunities for the prevention of Ebola outbreaks

The long-running and highly disruptive human Ebola outbreak in West Africa (responsible for >25 
000 reported human cases between December 2013 and early April 2015) demonstrates the 
public health challenge posed by the Ebola virus. Despite global attention and response, over 

fteen months into the outbreak the initial source of the outbreak had still not been de nitively 
identi ed (WHO 2015). While the number of new cases had shown signs of decline as of early 
April 2015, intense transmission was continuing in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone. Prior Ebola 
outbreaks in humans, and a concurrent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo beginning 
in August 2014, have been linked to the hunting or handling of wild animals, with subsequent 
human–human transmission (Rouquet et al. 2005; Feldmann and Geisbert 2011). Some bat species 
are the suspected natural reservoir for the virus and are thought to harbour it without symptoms. 
Investigations of wild animal carcasses have detected infection and mortality in chimpanzees, gorillas 
and duikers, suggesting that they may serve as intermediate hosts for potential human spill-over 
(Rouquet et al. 2005). Ebola virus has also been recognized as causing severe declines in great ape 
populations, especially critically endangered wild lowland gorilla troops (Leroy et al. 2004; Olson et 
al. 2012).

Ebola virus outbreaks in humans are typically sporadic, presenting a challenge for ongoing detection 
and monitoring (Leroy et al. 2004). Data generated from the Animal Mortality Monitoring Network 
in Gabon and Republic of Congo and subsequently the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT  programme suggest that surveillance for 
Ebola virus circulating in wildlife may enable early detection or prevention of Ebola virus outbreaks 
in humans (Rouquet et al. 2004; Olson et al. 2012). Finding fresh wild animal carcasses had been 
viewed as a food resource and a sign of good fortune for some hunting communities, but poses risks 
for human transmission (Karesh and Cook 2005). To manage and reduce risks from Ebola virus spill-
over, reporting of deceased or sick animal sightings by hunters and foresters can provide important 
sentinel bene ts for public health and conservation monitoring, informing opportunistic sampling 
by trained eld teams who can respond to reported morbidities and mortalities in wildlife with 
sampling and testing e orts (Rouquet et al. 2005; Olson et al. 2012). Additionally, non-invasive 
great ape faecal sampling may provide a cost-e ective surveillance method and provide data on 
Ebola virus exposures and survival to bene t conservation strategies (Reed et al. 2014). This One 
Health approach, paired with sharing of information on Ebola virus detection across health and 
wildlife authorities and local hunting communities, allows for targeted early detection e orts and 
implementation of preventive measures.

Box 1: lostridiu  di ile  a practical example of modulating gut microbiota

A gastrointestinal disorder characterized by diarrhoea and pain, caused by overgrowth of 
Clostridium difficile in the colon, provides a remarkable clinical example of the crucial importance 
of a correct balance of organisms within the gut microbiota, and illustrates practical ways of 
correcting such imbalance. Many people carry small numbers of C. difficile in their guts, but in 
some individuals antibiotic use can lead to overgrowth of this species, and to potentially life-
threatening colitis aggravated by toxin production. (The same phenomenon is commonly seen 
in antibiotic-treated pet guinea-pigs (Rothman 1981)). Recently it has been observed that faecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment in about 90% of patients (Cammarota 
et al. 2014). FMT involves administering faecal organisms from a normal donor (often a healthy 
family member). FMT suppresses growth of C. difficile and permits re-establishment of a normal 
microbiota. FMT is also undergoing trials in IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, and other chronic 
inflammatory conditions, though results remain variable (Borody et al. 2013).

Three important points need to be made here. First, as we learn more about the composition of 
a healthy microbiota and develop better ways of driving appropriate stable modifications of the 
microbiota, so our ability to treat diverse immunoregulatory and inflammatory disorders is likely 
to increase: this might also involve use of organisms from the natural environment. Secondly, we 
do not yet know whether people with different genetic backgrounds, or eating different diets, will 
require a different microbiota, though this is likely. Thirdly, as the number of conditions known to 
be modulated by the microbiota increases, so the selection of donors becomes more difficult. For 
example the material outlined in previous sections implies in addition to screening the donors 
for infections and load of C. difficile, we need to be sure that the donor is not obese, or at risk for 
cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, IBD, allergies or depression.

Case study: pl sia aliforni a and the human brain

Drugs derived from natural products may perhaps be the most direct and concrete bond that many 
may nd between biodiversity and medicine. However, biodiversity holds much broader connections 
with human health. In many arenas of biomedical inquiry, biodiversity has beenan invisible linchpin 
of discovery. For example, of the 104 Nobel prizes in Medicine awarded since Emil von Behring 
received the prizein 1901 for his research on guinea pigs to develop a treatment for diphtheria, 
99 were given to scientists who either directly or indirectly made use of other species to do their 
research.

In 2000, Eric Kandel shared the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine with Arvid Carlsson for his 
groundbreaking research on memory. Kandel s research established, at a cellular and molecular 
level, how our brains learn and form memories. He did not study human brains to do this. Instead, 
he studied the nervous system of sea hares from the genus Aplysia. A human brain has about 86 
billion neurons whereas Aplysia has, all told, around 20 000, and only about 100 of those neurons 
are involved in memory. In addition, Aplysia’s memory cells are also among the largest of their 
kind in the animal kingdom and can be visualized with the naked eye. This makes monitoring the 
electrical messages that scurry across their membranes, and exploring how these messages may alter 
genes and other molecules that control a neuron s inner workings, comparatively easy. With these 
advantages, Kandel found what was di cult, if not impossible, otherwise. What was gleaned from 
Aplysia’s nervous system made possible further research in other species, which has deepened our 
understanding not only of learning and memory, but of a host of human ailments, from substance 
abuse and Alzheimer disease to the lifelong consequences of early childhood trauma.

Case study: her us a uati us and DNA research

Thermus aquaticus is another behind-the-scenes, though absolutely vital, species for biomedical 
discovery. This bacterium was rst identi ed in the Mushroom Spring of ellowstone National Park 
in 1966 as part of an expedition to nd life in places where it was not supposed to exist. The late 
summer day that Thomas Brock and Hudson Freeze collected samples from Mushroom Spring, the 
water temperature measured 69 ºC.

At rst, T. aquaticus was little more than a curiosity: an organism able to live at temperatures that 
would cook most cells, including human cells. This reputation soon changed. Advances in the early 
years of genetic research were many but were limited in part by di culties with replicating DNA in a 
laboratory. All life replicates DNA in order to survive. To do this, paired strands of DNA are separated 
and then copied using a specialized molecular copying machine known as DNA polymerase. 
To separate the DNA strands, cells use a set of molecular machines. Using these machines in a 
laboratory proved too di cult, so scientists turned to another method, heat. DNA strands reliably 
separate at temperatures just over 90 ºC and remain separate at around 70 ºC, right near the optimal 
temperature for T. aquaticus and its DNA polymerase known as Taq. The ability of Taq to copy DNA at 
high temperature forms the foundation of the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which is arguably 
the single most important tool in genetic research ever invented. In 2013 alone, nearly 27 000 
articles make reference to PCR in the US  National Library of Medicine s PubMed database.

ust as with the ability of natural products obtained from one species to exert in uence on many 
others, the ability of Taq to work on DNA from multiple species underscores how all life shares some 
basic features. At the same time, Taq also speaks of the importance of the diversity of life. Without life 
thriving at high temperatures, there would be no polymerase suitable for PCR and, without PCR, the 
modern-day genetic research juggernaut may never have got o  the ground.

Case study: diclofenac and decline in the population of vultures

The Indian subcontinent was once home to several million vultures. These birds played a vital role 
in the ecosystem, cleaning up carcasses of dead animals, and thereby helping to reduce the risk of 
disease and contamination of soil and water resources. Their numbers were supported by the huge 
numbers of livestock; India alone has the largest cattle population in the world. Dead livestock 
are usually left out in the open for removal by vultures – the quickest, cheapest and most e cient 
natural disposal method. But a drastic decline in vulture numbers began in the 1990s. The three 
most abundant species – the oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis), the Indian vulture 
(G. indicus) and the slender-billed vulture (G. tenuirostris) declined by more than 95% in Pakistan, 
India and Nepal between 1990 and 2001. It became evident that the decline in vulture numbers was 
having an impact on ecosystem functioning, as evidenced by the number of animal carcasses that 
were left to decay in elds across the Indian subcontinent. This has helped to boost numbers of feral 
dogs, rats and other scavengers, resulting in a greatly increased threat of rabies and other diseases in 
the human population.

Postmortems on vulture carcasses determined that massive numbers of vultures were dying 
from visceral gout – the accumulation of uric acid deposits associated with kidney failure, but 
microbiological and toxicological studies failed to pinpoint the cause as the decline progressed. 
Eventually, an investigation of the primary food source of Gyps vultures – livestock carcasses – led 
to the identi cation of a pharmaceutical compound, diclofenac sodium, as the cause. Diclofenac has 
been widely administered by veterinarians and famers in analgesic, antirheumatic and antimicrobial 
preparations, and its availability increased greatly in the early 1990s due to numerous market 
factors. There have been reports of widespread abuse of the prescription laws that should restrict 
drug sales, with poor dose controls for humans and livestock. This drug has been shown to be highly 
toxic to vultures at the levels to which they are exposed from livestock carcasses. Diclofenac has 
been banned in India, Pakistan and Nepal since 2008; however, there is concern that the ban is being 
circumvented or ignored in some areas, and more widespread controls are required, as well as greater 
cooperation with the farming community, if vulture populations are to recover in the region.

Studies have shown that African Gyps vultures are equally vulnerable to diclofenac poisoning, 
suggesting that the risk may extend to all Gyps species, and there are concerns that many other 
scavenging bird species are also susceptible. With the recent controversy over the approval of 
diclofenac for veterinary use in parts of Europe, including Spain, which is internationally important 
for avian scavengers, it is clear that there is a need for environmental risk assessments of veterinary 
medicines to take a multidisciplinary perspective, based on the full scope of scienti c evidence, and 
for regulatory authorities to take necessary precautions to prevent environmental contamination with 
veterinary APIs.

Box 1. Traditional medicine in a changing world: the example of Peru 

The demand for traditional medicine is increasing in Peru, as indicated by the increase in number of 
herb vendors in recent years, in particular, in the markets of Trujillo. A wide variety of medicinal plants 
from northern Peru can also be found in the global market. While this trend might help to maintain 
traditional practices and give recognition to traditional knowledge, it poses a serious threat, as signs 
of overharvesting of important species are becoming increasingly apparent.

More than two thirds of all species sold in Peruvian markets are claimed to originate from the 
highlands (sierra), above the timberline, which represent areas often heavily used for agriculture 
and livestock grazing. The overall value of medicinal plants in the markets of northern Peru alone 
reaches US  1.2 million/year. Medicinal plants contribute signi cantly to the local economy. Such 
an important market raises questions around the sustainability of this trade, especially because the 
market analysis does not take into account any informal sales.

Most striking, perhaps, is the fact that seven indigenous and three exotic species, i.e. 2.5% of all 
species traded, account for more than 40% of the total sales volume. Moreover, 31 native species 
account for 50% of all sales, while only 16 introduced plants contribute to more than a quarter of 
all material sold. About one third of this sales volume includes all exotic species traded. None of 
these species are rare or endangered. However, the rising market demand might lead to increased 
production of these exotics, which in turn could have negative e ects on the local ora (Bussmann et 
al. 2007b).

A look at the indigenous species traded highlights important conservation threats. Croton lechleri 
(dragon s blood), and Uncaria tomentosa (cat s claw) are immensely popular at a local level, and 
each contributes to about 7% to the overall market value. Both species are also widely traded 
internationally. The latex of Croton is harvested by cutting or debarking the whole tree. Uncaria is 
mostly traded as bark, and again the whole plant is normally debarked. Croton is a pioneer species, 
and apart from C. lechleri, a few other species of the genus have found their way into the market. 
Sustainable production of this genus seems possible, but the process must be closely monitored, 
and current practice does not appear sustainable because most Croton is wild harvested. The trade

in cat s claw is so immense that, in fact, years ago collectors of this primary forest liana began to 
complain about a lack of resources and it was found that often other Uncaria species, or even Acacia 
species have appeared in the market as “cat s claw”. This is clearly not sustainable.

Some of the other “most important traditional medicinal” species in northern Peru are either 
common weeds (e.g. Desmodium molliculum), or have large populations (e.g. Equisetum giganteum). 
Nevertheless, a number of species are very vulnerable: Gentianella alborosea, G. bicolor, G. graminea, 
Geranium ayavacense and Laccopetalum giganteum are all high-altitude species with very limited 
distribution. Their large-scale collection is clearly unsustainable. In the case of Laccopetalum, 
collectors indicate that nding supplies is becoming increasingly di cult. The fate of a number 
of species with similar habitat requirements raises comparable concerns. The only species under 
cultivation at present are exotics, and a few common indigenous species.

There are profound challenges when it comes to the safety of the plants employed, in particular, 
for applications that require long-term use. Some studies found that various species were often 
sold under the same common names. Some of the di erent fresh species are readily identi able 
(botanically), but neither the collectors nor the vendors make a direct distinction between species. 
Often, material is sold in nely powdered form, which makes the morphological identi cation of 
the species in the market impossible, and greatly increases the risk for the buyer. The best way 
to ensure correct identi cation would be DNA bar-coding. The necessary technical infrastructure 
is, however, not available locally. The use of DNA bar-coding as a quality control tool to verify 
species composition of samples on a large scale would require careful sampling of every batch 
of plant material sold in the market. The volatility of the markets makes this a very di cult task 
from a logistical standpoint. Furthermore, there is no consistency in the dosage of plants used, and 
vendors do not agree on the possible side-e ects. Even in the case of plant species used for clearly 
circumscribed applications, patients run a considerable risk when purchasing their remedies in the 
local markets. Much more control is needed, as well as stringent identi cation of the material sold in 
public markets, and those that enter the global supply chain via Internet sales.

Box 2. Conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants in India

It is estimated that in India, around 300 plants and a few faunal species are in various threat categories 
and their cultivation is not yet a viable economic option due to the preference for wild sourcing, 
given lower costs (FRLHT 2009). There is also a general lack of information on agrotechniques 
(Hamilton 2004).

To address these pressing issues, the Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT) 
in India initiated the establishment of the largest global in-situ conservation network by establishing 
medicinal plant conservation areas (MPCAs) – as an integrated approach to in-situ and ex-situ 
conservation programmes. The rationale is to conserve and study medicinal plants in their natural 
habitats and preserve their gene pool, and to further develop strategies for the management of 
rare, endangered and vulnerable species. The areas not only provide a good locale for studies on 
threat assessment, population studies and mapping, but also for participatory forest management, as 
well as for policy-makers, the community and civil society organizations. Between 1993 and 2014, 
FRLHT, jointly with the State Forest Departments, established 110 MPCAs across 12 Indian states 
in a globally unique model of PPP. The programme has been spearheaded in collaboration with the 
Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests, and through the support of organizations such as the 
Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA), United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and Global Environmental Facility (GEF). Due to its success, the Planning Commission of India 
recommended the establishment of 200 MPCAs across the country (Tenth Five- ear Plan, 2002).  
There is also a recent move to recognize these locations as biodiversity heritage sites. A related 
initiative is the establishment of medicinal plant conservation parks (MPCPs) – a community-based 
ex-situ conservation initiative aimed at sustainable use of medicinal plant resources and preserving 
knowledge associated with their use. Coordinated by FRLHT along with other nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations, a chain of MPCPs has been set up in 
various parts of India.  Attempts have also been made in pilot locations to integrate such medicinal 
plant-based practices in formal primary health-care centres, apart from promoting them through 
community health programmes. Within a geographical region, communities have been mobilized to 
create:

• ethnomedicinal forests and resource centres housing herbaria and crude drug collections;

• local pharmacopoeia databases based on community knowledge;

• community and home herbal gardens and seed banks;

• outreach nurseries for the promotion of cultivation and a sustainable wild collection of medicinal 
plants;

• trade and enterprise development that aids in income generation.

Moving up the value chain, FRLHT also established a medicinal plant conservation network (MPCN) 
jointly with a number of NGOs working with di erent rural communities. As part of this e ort, 
traditional healers  associations have been formed at di erent levels of administration from the 
province downwards. The associations conduct regular meetings and exchange of information

among healers and act according to self-regulatory guidelines, which have been evolved through a 
participatory process based on the contextual peculiarities of each province. Healers  associations 
along with NGOs and forest departments have been actively engaged in supporting medicinal plant 
conservation programmes in various states.

The MPCN is also working on the following issues:

• establishing herbal gardens;

• developing appraisal systems of healers  capacities and training programmes;

• conducting action research interventions in key health areas such as malaria;

• facilitating networking through organizing medical camps, and district- and state-level conventions 
of healers  associations, but also healer exchange visits within the country and among other Asian 
and African countries.

Box 3. Sustainable harvest and standards – The FairWild Standard example

The FairWild Standard provides a set of best practice guidelines for the sustainable use and trade 
of wild harvested medicinal plants. It provides a basis for assessing the harvest and trade of wild 
plants against various ecological, social and economic requirements. It was developed through 
a multistakeholder consultation process that has engaged a wide range of organizations and 
individuals involved with the harvesting and trade of these resources.

Use of the FairWild Standard helps support e orts to ensure that plants are managed, harvested 
and traded in a way that maintains populations in the wild and bene ts rural producers. Version 
2.0 of the Standard was developed following the merger of two initiatives: International Standard 
for Sustainable Wild Collection of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (ISSC-MAP), which focused on 
ecological conservation and some social/ethical aspects, and the original FairWild Standard, which 
focused on social and fair trade aspects. The resulting set of principles and criteria covers eleven key 
areas of sustainability. It is designed to be an applicable framework in a variety of implementation 
contexts, as well as to be used as the basis for a third-party certi cation scheme.

During the development of the FairWild Standard, a number of pilot projects were carried out in 
locations around the world to test its applicability. These projects included the collection of ingredients 
used in traditional medicine; for example, the pilots of ISSC-MAP in India under the project “Saving 
Plants that Save Lives and Livelihoods”, supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and implemented by FRLHT and TRAFFIC India. One of the 

rst studies was conducted in Karnataka, India. Through a participatory planning approach involving 
various stakeholders such as scientists and community members, a task team was set up for mapping 
resources and elaborating a sustainable harvesting strategy. As part of the methodology involved 
documentation of medicinal plant-related knowledge and non-timber forest product (NTFP) collection 
practices, resource assessments were conducted for selected species. Training was provided for 
mapping and assessing di erent harvesting methods. It was found that a well-organized stakeholder 
group can plan and implement an e ective participatory resource management strategy. Apart from 

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 185



standardizing and eld-testing the methodology, training modules for wider user groups have been 
developed. This will be a useful strategy for biodiversity or joint forest management committees 
through a community-to-community training programme (Unnikrishnan and Suneetha 2012).

Innovation with the FairWild Standard continues in India, with a certi cation pilot now under way 
in the Western Ghats. With nancial support from the United Kingdom (UK) s Department for 
International Development (DfID)/Department for Environment, Food and Rural A airs (DEFRA) 
Darwin Initiative and the Keidanren Nature Conservation Foundation, the project intends to increase 
the capacity of targeted local communities to adapt to climate change and participate in biodiversity 
conservation through the improved management of socioecological landscapes. It is implemented 
by the Durrell Institute for Conservation and Ecology (DICE), the Indian NGO Applied Environmental 
Research Foundation (AERF), UK manufacturer Pukka Herbs Ltd. and TRAFFIC. The project aims to 
establish supply chains for sustainable harvesting and fair trade in fruit of two tree species used 
in Ayurvedic medicine (Terminalia bellirica and T. chebula). A FairWild certi cation protocol is to be 
developed for the collection of these species and for establishing a community-regulated mechanism 
for access and bene t sharing.

The FairWild Standard has also been implemented in other countries of Asia, South America, Africa 
and Europe (Kathe et al. 2010). In addition to being used by communities for the management of 
medicinal plant resources, the principles of the FairWild Standard can be used by industry for the 
development of a sourcing policy to support the development and/or strengthening of national 
resource management policies and regulations. Of particular relevance to the topic of biodiversity 
and traditional health is a project that is currently under way as part of the European Union (EU)–
China Environmental Governance Programme, which experiments with promoting the adoption of 
sustainable sourcing according to the FairWild Standard in the traditional Chinese medicine sector, as 
part of a corporate social responsibility framework. In the international arena, it has also been drawn 
upon in the development of best practice methodologies for carrying out non-detriment ndings 
(NDF) by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Speciesof Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES), and as a practical tool for implementing and reporting against the sustainable use objective 
of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC), as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) s Aichi Targets 4 and 6.

Box 4. Therapeutic and sacred landscapes

Mayan people maintain a healthy or whole relationship with mother earth and the cosmos through 
an intricate system of practices and knowledge known as Maya Science (Monterroso & Azurdia Bravo 
2008). This divine relationship is enacted by the measure of time using the stars and constellations 
but also through the use of sacred sites and traditional medicine (Gomez & Caal 2003). The sacred 
sites (natural and constructed) are places to connect with the ancestors and to contemplate one s 
role in relation to the social and natural world, but they are also places for healing in the landscape 
(Gomez et al. 2010). In Guatemala as well as in many other countries, these sacred places are often 
viewed as a biocultural network that spans land and seascapes, and embody a spiritual dimension 
of well-being and often underrecognized healing potential (Dobson & Mamyev 2010; Delgado et al. 
2010; Verschuuren et al. 2014).

Reyes-García (2010) reviewed the literature on traditional medicine and concluded that the holistic 
nature of traditional knowledge systems helps to not only understand a plant s e cacy in its cultural 
context but also improves our understanding of how ethnopharmacological knowledge is distributed 
in a society, and who bene ts from it. In Guatemala, spiritual leaders, midwives, paediatricians, 
naturopaths, and other traditional healers help counteract the various health problems in 
communities. To the traditional Mayan healer, the body is composed of the sacred elements; earth, 
water, re and air, which correspond to the sun, moon and stars. Therefore, use of traditional medicine 
is practised based on the date of birth in the sacred Mayan calendar (Monterroso & Bravo 2008).

Within the context of the Mayan calendar, traditional healers know that diseases stem from the 
spiritual, physical and psychological imbalance of a person, either from wilful violation of proper 
conduct or due to lack of awareness. Due to colonization and consequent impacts on local and 
indigenous communities, many traditional practices are fragmented and often combined with 
elements of western medicine. They are often under ideological pressure and suspicion for the 
lack a homogeneous theory, while resource scarcity is also an increasing problem underlying the 
production of many traditional medicines (Delgado & Gomez 2003). Viewing these problems as part 
of the erosion of cultural knowledge and practices can help in determining suitable and culturally 
appropriate solutions. For example, Pesek et al. (2009), who researched Maya eqchi  knowledge on 
medicinal plants and their ecosystems, concluded that traditional ways of protecting plant diversity 
were better suited to medicinal plant conservation than external conservation solutions based on 
conservation biology.

Garcia et al. (1999) describe how Mayan medicine in Mexico was reinforced by systematizing the 
knowledge and experience of 40 traditional healers, and comparing these with other medical 
traditions, such as Chinese health systems. Striking similarities were encountered, both in concepts 
as well as practices, such as acupuncture, massage and the use of certain herbs and spiritual 
healing techniques. This was used to reinforce the local traditional health system, as well as to 
disseminate the experiences among traditional healers elsewhere in Central America. The exchange 
of healers  knowledge and practices is generally valued as an invigorating experience that can also 
provide a platform for the legal recognition of traditional health practitioners (Traditional Health 
Practioners 2010).

Box 5: Participatory approaches to validation: experiences from Palau and Mali

A relevant example linking traditional medicines and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is the 
survey performed in Palau on traditional medicines (or health practices) and NCDs – chie y diabetes 
and high blood pressure. A nationwide survey was carried out to determine which traditional 
medicines are most commonly used to treat these conditions, and what was the perceived 
e ectiveness. Data were collected as part of a training course on scienti c research. A distinctive 
feature of the results obtained was that, among 30 plants used for diabetes, two were the most 
common (Table 1).

Morinda citrifolia ngel/noni 12 0 (0%)

Phyllanthus palauensis ukelel a chedib 4 1 (25%)

The di erence between the reported outcomes with the two most commonly used plants was 
statistically tested. When comparing reported outcomes of P. nisidai and M. citrifolia, P. nisidai was 
statistically more often associated with the reported outcome “lower blood sugar” (P=0.01). None of 
the patients using M. citrifolia reported the outcome “lower blood sugar”, even though this plant was 
the second most frequently used.

Following the identi cation of P. nisidai through this brief survey, a literature search was performed 
to identify a potential link between the results obtained and what is known about the antidiabetic 
properties of the plant. It was found that the high mangiferin content of P. nisidai could explain the 
observed e ects. Indeed, in vitro and animal studies on this substance showed improvement in the 
glucose tolerance test, inhibition of alpha amylase, alpha glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (as 
with some of the most recent antidiabetic drugs), increased insulin secretion and a hypolipidaemic 
e ect (Kitalong 2012).

In a study on traditional treatments for malaria in Mali, use of the retrospective treatment outcome 
(RTO) method resulted in a database of treatments taken for malaria cases in 952 households. From 
the 66 plants used, alone or in various combinations, one was clearly associated with the best 
outcomes: a decoction of Argemone mexicana (Table 2) (Diallo et al. 2007).

The recipe that showed the best outcomes in patients, a single plant in its traditional mode of 
preparation and utilization, was selected for a further dose-escalating observational study, followed 
by a randomized, prospective, comparative clinical trial (randomized controlled trial with the selected 
local remedy versus the standard, imported treatment). After these clinical studies, the search for 
active compounds was undertaken. The whole research process was labelled “reverse pharmacology” 
or, more speci cally, “bedside-to-bench” approach.

Box 6: Traditional antimalarials – RITAM experience

There are a number of successful models and programmes for preventive and curative health 
interventions that use traditional medicine and practices to achieve the desired goals. In the eld 
of malaria treatment, there is the Research Initiative on Traditional Antimalarial Methods (RITAM), 
which was initiated in 2001 (Willcox et al. 2003; Willcox & Bodeker 2004 www.gifts-ritam.org). This 
initiative is based on a group of international researchers exploring ways to increase the relevance 
of including traditional medicine in the repertoire of choices available for the prevention and cure 
of malaria. As such, RITAM is working on traditional antimalarials with more than 200 members from 
over 30 countries. A systematic literature review by RITAM indicates that numerous plant species 
are used to treat malaria or fever. In India, FRLHT has been assessing the e ectiveness of traditional 
medicine for malaria prevention through a participatory community-based approach. This includes 
conducting a literature survey on plant drugs used for malaria management, as well as documenting 
traditional antimalarial remedies and dietary rules for malaria prevention. Finally, pharmacological 
references of the toxicology and e cacy of these practices from Ayurvedic and modern medical 
literature are compiled. As part of FRLHT s malaria prophylaxis approach, communities in selected 
endemic areas follow a regimen of malaria prevention (mainly consisting of an herbal decoction) 
during the monsoon season for a selected period. The safety of the practice is assured and the 
remedy is prepared fresh on speci c days at a community centre. By using a cohort study approach, 
groups based in several regions that do not follow this regimen are compared with those that do. 
Data gathered in the documentation has shown positive results for malaria prevention, indicated by 
statistically signi cant positive outcomes.

Box 7: Home herbal gardens as a self-reliant community health programme

A self-reliant approach to managing simple, common health conditions can reduce the health 
expenditure of poor rural households and rural indebtedness in many developing countries (Van 
Damme et al. 2003). Home herbal gardens, as conceived by the FRLHT, are a collection of 15–20 
prioritized medicinal and nutritional plants, and have become a successful model for a self-reliant 
community health programme. Apart from being a conservation milieu for medicinal plants, it also 
addresses nutritional challenges. In most rural communities, knowledgeable women take care of 
certain primary health needs of the family members and the gardens become a handy resource for 
them. Some women, by taking on the role of suppliers of seedlings for the programme, also earn 
supplementary incomes.

resources and equitable sharing of benefits arising integrate these issues while raising the capacities 
from their commercial utilization.¹¹ The example of multiple stakeholders in achieving better public 
in Box 8 illustrates an initiative that attempts to health outcomes in Africa.

Box 8: Capacity building on plant research for better public health in Africa

The Bamako Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health organized by WHO was held in November 
2008 to strengthen research for health, development and equity. The Bamako call to action notably 
prioritized the development of policies for research and innovation in health, especially related to 
primary health care and the strengthening of research capacity by building a critical mass of young 
researchers (WHO 2008). It was this call to action that led to the creation of the Multidisciplinary 
University Traditional Health Initiative (MUTHI): Building Sustainable Research Capacity on Plants for 
Better Public Health in Africa, initiated in anuary 2010 and set to be nalized in December 2014.

The MUTHI project was established with European Union funding (Framework 7 Programme) to build 
more sustainable plant research capacity and research networks between key institutions in Africa 
(Mali, South Africa and Uganda) and a group of partner research institutions in Europe (Norway, UK 
and the Netherlands) to attain better health in Africa (MUTHI 2013). The project has provided a four-
year capacity-building programme, in which African researchers are trained in all the necessary 
skills to produce and commercialize safe and standardized improved traditional medicines (ITM), 
and are trained in intellectual property rights (IPR) regulations and principles of access and bene t-
sharing (ABS). The project is based on the needs of the African partner institutes to strengthen their 
ethnopharmacological research capacities in the area of ITM.

For more e ectiveness, the MUTHI project has been divided into work packages that each focus on 
a di erent aspect of the project: (1) training in medical anthropological and ethnopharmacological 
research skills to conduct high-quality ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological research on 
medicinal plants; (2) quality control of phytomedicines and nutraceuticals; (3) investigative 
bioactivity and safety of phytomedicines and nutraceuticals, with the objectives of assessing 
the needs of African institutes and developing the capabilities of researchers for bioassays, data 
management, quality assurance, bioactivity evaluation, safety aspects and developing guidelines; (4) 
identify researchers  needs for clinical and public health training, and build the capacity of traditional 
medicine researchers on all aspects of the subject, including writing and data analysis; (5) examine 
ethics and IPR, aiming to assess training and education requirements for stakeholders on IPR, 
biodiversity legislation and regulation, ABS, and ethics of traditional medicine and research methods 
(Bodeker et al. 2014, Bodeker et al. 2015). A sixth work package is charged with project management.

The benchmark referenced in the MUTHI project is the Code of Ethics of the International Society 
of Ethnobiology (ISE), initiated in 1996 and completed in 2006. Contrary to other frameworks, the 
ISE Code of Ethics addresses the rights of the individual knowledge holders. Participants of the 

rst work package conducting an ethnobotanical and retrospective treatment outcome study have 
been trained through workshops focused on research skills, ethics and IPR, and have received 
online guidance in writing their research proposals, including a section on research ethics and free 
prior informed consent (FPIC). The latter had to be established at individual and collective levels,

communities were provided with complete, comprehensive information regarding the purpose and

including all reasonably foreseeable bene ts and risks of harm (be they tangible or intangible) 
to a ected communities. The work package team that is responsible for all aspects related to IPR 
and ABS within the MUTHI project provided a needs assessment followed by workshops on ethics 
and IPR, and mentored participants from all of the partner countries in developing memoranda of 
understanding between researchers and traditional healers, including aspects related to FPIC and 
ABS. The drafting phase of the memoranda of understanding was an ongoing process between the 
researchers and traditional healers in order to reach a nal memorandum of understanding approved 
by all stakeholders (Bodeker et al. 2015).

Box 9. Community livelihoods – linking conservation with community health

There are several successful cases that highlight how the sustainable management of medicinal 
plants can impact community livelihoods, leading to income generation and improved community 
health (see, for example, Hamilton 2004; Hamilton & Hamilton 2006). 

One such initiative is the Muliru Farmers Conservation Group, a community-based organization 
located near Kakamega forest in western Kenya. The group generates income through the commercial 
cultivation and secondary processing of an indigenous medicinal plant, Ocimum kilimandscharicum to 
produce the Naturub® brand of medicinal products.

The enterprise reduces pressure on the biodiverse Kakamega forest by o ering an alternative to the 
exploitation of forest resources, while the commercialization of the medicinal plant has heightened 
local appreciation of the value of the forest s biodiversity. Over half of the project participants are 
women and 40% of participants rely entirely on this initiative for their income. The enterprise invests 
a portion of its revenues in forest conservation and biodiversity.

Since the processing facility opened, over 770 tons of community cultivated O. kilimandscharicum 
leaves have been processed. Over 400 000 units of Naturub® products have been sold in both 
urban and rural areas of Kenya. The products have received wide acceptance in the market. The total 
revenue from the project thus far has been over US  70 000. Currently, over 360 rural households 
cultivate the plant on smallholder farms.

Box 10. Herbanisation: an open-access, medicinal street garden project for greening, 
healing and connecting in Cape Town, South Africa

Cape Town, South Africa is home to a vast trade in medicinal plants, with 262 tonnes of wild 
medicine being harvested from within the city annually (Petersen et al. 2014a; Reid 2014). The 
illicit harvest of plant material from the city s protected areas, prompted by local demand and the 
economic marginalization of many healers, has brought herbalists and conservation authorities into 
con ict. The intersection of conservation priorities, livelihoods based on wild-harvested plants, and 
health and well-being has resulted in a conservation conundrum (Petersen 2014b). It was in light of 
this conundrum that the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation, a nongovernmental organization based 
in Cape Town, collaborated with Rasta bushdoctor (herbalist) partners to establish “Herbanisation”.

Herbanisation is an open-access, medicinal street garden project based in Cape Town. The project 
aims to green degraded streetscapes in economically marginalized areas while contributing to the 
livelihoods of local Rasta and Khoi herbalists, and reconnecting community members with medicinal 
plants and indigenous knowledge. Herbanisation began as a pilot project of 250 medicinal plants 
in 2012. Originating in Seawinds, an area of high unemployment and many social ills such as 
gangsterism, drug abuse and violence, the garden was established on a pavement beside an existing 
community nursery, with open access to local healers and the community. The project wanted to 
connect, heal and green the community through plants. Since the inception of the pilot project in 
2012, Herbanisation has expanded to include approximately 1700 plants in Seawinds, Cape Town, 
and is set to reach 4500 by mid-2015.

Herbanisation has already resulted in groundbreaking engagement between Rasta herbalists, 
conservation bodies and local botanical organizations. In addition, the project is strengthening 
linkages between park activities and urban conservation e orts, making local nature a key driver 
of urban renewal e orts. In terms of the impact on the local neighbourhood, many Seawinds 
residents and local traditional healers harvest from the Herbanisation street gardens in order to treat 
themselves and their families. Not only does this contribute to the health and well-being of the local 
community, but it also empowers individuals to take their health into their own hands and feel proud 
of their role as indigenous knowledge bearers.

Three guiding principles have been key to the success of the project to date. First, work with local 
champions: our project was born out of a partnership with Neville van Schalkwyk, an accomplished 
gardener and Rasta herbalist elder in Seawinds. Working with established, respected and dependable 
individuals is key to project longevity and success. Second, use gardens as vehicles: while providing 
herbalists and the community access to medicinal plants is a key aspect of the project, the gardens 
also serve as places and processes through which conversation is enabled between herbalists, 
conservation authorities and the government. This is vital in linking grass-roots community e orts 
with regional policy design and implementation. Third, apply open-access principles: we have chosen 
to establish gardens on disused public open spaces where plants are freely accessible to the local 
people. This model encourages interaction between people and plants, while stimulating knowledge 
exchange and fostering a sense of community participation and ownership.

connections to the natural world, today more than half of the world’s population lives in cities, often reducing contact with 
biodiversity to infrequent time spent in green spaces and visits to parks. Consequently, Western cultures are increasingly

Box 1. Enabling environments for mental health rehabilitation

Research by enny Roe and Peter A. Aspinall has indicated that some environments may be more 
favourable to mood and cognitive recovery in people with severe mental health problems than 
others. They compared the restorative bene ts of walking in urban and rural settings in a group 
of adults with a range of mental health problems, including people with schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders (N=24). Two aspects of psychological restoration were examined, rstly mood, 
and the other using personal project techniques (Little 1983) to capture cognitive re ection on 
everyday life tasks. Participants walked in small groups of around 8 in a variety of urban and rural 
settings in central Scotland. As anticipated – and consistent with restorative theory – a walk in a 
natural setting was advantageous to mood recovery and cognitive re ection on the management of 
personal projects. However, contrary to other evidence showing negative e ects of walking in urban 
settings on people with psychotic disorders (Ellett et al. 2008), in this instance, a walk in a busy 
historic urban district generated a positive change in mental well-being.

Supporting qualitative research (via semi-structured interviews) (N=24) indicated stronger 
preferences for walking in the natural setting further a eld, as compared to walking in the 
hometown; being away from their everyday environments allowed mental health patients to escape 
stigmatization and facilitated anonymity. Symptom relief from psychosis and schizophrenia included 
a reduction in auditory hallucinations (i.e. hearing noises) in the natural setting.

The research concludes that walking in some urban environments (for example, historic districts and 
city green spaces) – as well as further a eld natural settings – o ers the potential to promote physical 
activity and mental well-being in people with severe mental health problems (Roe and Aspinall 2011b). 
These ndings have in general informed UK health policy and in particular initiatives such as the 
Scottish Government s “green prescriptions” and the Green Exercise Partnership between the National 
Health Service (NHS) Health Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage, 
which are designed to promote greater use of the outdoors for better health and quality of life.

Box 2. Designing for a healing environment: Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, a 590-bed acute care hospital in Singapore, aptly presents a case where 
urban greenery, including biological complexity in terms of species richness and habitat heterogeneity, 
has been incorporated into the hospital design to reap the associative bene ts of healing and well-
being. The hospital s concept of “a healing environment” emphasizes the nexus between greenery and 
well-being in three aspects: rst, direct bene ts of greenery towards the healing of patients; second, 
capitalizing on the nexus to improve the livability of the urban environment for both the individual 
resident and the community; and third, promoting biological complexity in terms of a biodiverse and 
heterogeneous environment that also contributes to human well-being.

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 203



The wards and corridors of the hospital are 
designed to support patients in the healing 
process. At ground, the nexus between 
biodiversity and well-being is explored 
through the richly planted parklands and 
the ishun Pond, whose lush environs are 
attractive not only to patients and visitors, 
but also to residents in the surrounding 
neighbourhoods. The promenade along 
the edges of the pond and the hospital 
gardens connects to the adjacent housing 
estate and train station beyond the hospital 
grounds, providing seamless access to the 
surrounding communities. The gardens 
have attractive water features, including a 
designed cascading waterfall, adding sound 
and movement to the environment.

To extend the concept of integration with 
the community, a rooftop farm grows 
food crops that are tended by community 
volunteers and former patients. The crops 
provide a relatively cheap source of organic 
food of approximately 208 kg per year for the hospital kitchen, while the harvesting and sale of 
produce to the public contributes to the hospital green fund. There are over 50 species of fruit trees, 
and 50 vegetables and herbs in this rooftop farm. The volunteers get to socialize, and bringing their 
harvest home is both a source of pride and joy, and a therapeutic activity, particularly for the older 
volunteers who are mostly retirees.

The planting in and around the hospital emphasizes biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity, 
particularly in terms of birds and butter ies, and fruit trees. In the pond, 100 species of South-
East Asian tropical sh have been recorded, some of which were thought to have become extinct. 
There are reported sightings of 48 species of birds, 44 species of butter ies and 21 species of 
dragon ies and damsel ies. The “medicinal garden” has over 100 species of medicinal plants used 
in traditional medicine. The pond with its owering plants at the edges, and its oating mounds, 
attracts butter ies, dragon ies as well as bird species, which in turn feed on the sh, creating a 
microecosystem of its own.

The hospital epitomizes the idea of a healing environment in its numerous design dimensions 
and innovations. It exempli es an urban asset that goes beyond incorporating landscapes for their 
aesthetic qualities, and also purposefully and meaningfully seeks to bring biodiversity into urban 
spaces, all of which contribute to a pervasive sense of well-being that extends to the surrounding 
community.

Physical inactivity is a risk factor for NCDs and is estimated to be responsible for 3.2 million deaths 
annually (Lim et al. 2013). Many studies show signi cant global health bene ts from shifting to 
environmentally sustainable practices. For example, active commuting in Shanghai, China, reduced

Box 4. Active in Parks Program, Victoria, Australia

The Active in Parks Program forms partnerships between park managers and health and community 
service agencies to connect people to parks and open spaces to improve physical and mental 
well-being. The outreach is through tailored activities that increase people s physical activity and 
overcome barriers, such as transport, lack of awareness and fear, to support their access to parks and 
other natural open spaces.

The Program commenced in 2010 as a pilot in Geelong, a major regional city in Victoria, Australia. 
It addresses a number of key health issues, including social isolation, mental health, physical 
inactivity and priority chronic diseases. Geelong is an area with a prevalence of preventable diseases, 
particularly in low socioeconomic communities, and is surrounded by outstanding parks and open 
spaces that are now part of the solution to getting more people more physically and socially active 
more often, and improving individual and community health and well-being. This is the “Healthy 
Parks Healthy People” approach to park 
management.

The Program includes ve elements:

Green referrals: physically inactive people at 
risk of developing or already su ering from 
chronic illness are referred by their health 
professional to a physical activity programme 
based in local parks. They are supported by 
quali ed instructors and encouraged to do 
ongoing exercise.

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 207



Welcome to new migrants: park outings involving physical activity, such as sur ng, shing and 
beach walking, help newly settled Victorians from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds to 
independently engage in physical activity outdoors and reduce their risk of being socially isolated.

Youth park ambassadors: secondary school students at risk of developing a mental illness and/or 
disengaging in school take part in outdoor adventure activities to build con dence, resilience and 
connection with nature, then encourage others to get “Active in Parks”.

Adolescent education: young people with type 1 diabetes learn how to manage their chronic illness 
and treatment while being physically active in nature and making social connections with others.

Parks walks: regular, volunteer walking groups enjoy parks and open spaces, while strengthening 
community connectedness and encouraging regular outdoor enjoyment of nature.

Participants have credited the Program with restoring their con dence, improving their motor skills 
and, most importantly, giving them a more positive attitude towards physical activity. Post-Program 
surveys have unanimously rated the contribution of the Active in Parks Program as bene cial to 
health and well-being.

Almost 100% of Program participants from uly 2013 to December 2013 reported gaining 
friendships from the Program, with 30% of participants now meeting independently on a regular 
basis. In 2014, over 66% of respondents reported that the Program increased the time they spent in 
a park, and over 86% reported that the Program changed their attitude/behaviour towards physical 
activity. Over 93% of respondents planned on continuing to exercise on their own.

Box 5. Biodiversity, essential for Mbya Guarani well-being and health 

Those indigenous people that survive as hunters, gatherers and small-scale agriculturalists display 
complex relationships between territory, biodiversity and ecodiversity (Montenegro 1992; 2006). 
Among the Mbya Guarani who live in relatively self-decided isolation, like the communities of Tekoa 

ma and Tekoa Kapi i vate in the subtropical forest of aboti (Misiones, Argentina), their well-being 
and health system is the result of complex sustainable interactions. The main variables involved are 
growing knowledge of the social and natural environment, e cient intergenerational transmission of 
information, entire life educative schemes, lack of permanent private property and adaptive nomadic 
behaviour. Their dominant long food chain strategy ensures direct and seasonal relationships with 
di erent arrangements for biodiversity. Contemporary communities use, for example, 150 species 
of medicinal plants, 35 plant species and 94 animal species as food, 54 species as raw materials for 
rituals, artifacts, weapons and building, and 61 species as fuel (biomass) (Keller 2001; Montenegro 
2004). Deforestation and biodiversity loss, mainly produced by foreigners, negatively a ects not 
just their health system but also their rituals and well-being. Ñemongarai, the ceremony where the 
opygua (= shaman) delivers names to children, demands – for boys – fruits of guembe epiphyte 
(Philodendron bipinnati dum) and honey from the wild bee jate’i (Tetragonisca angustula). Their 
growing scarcity in abotí, as a result of biodiversity reduction, distresses both families of children 
and the community (Montenegro 2004). Currently, most indigenous peoples develop hybrid 
strategies that combine both traditional and foreign medicine (cf. Montenegro & Stephens 2006).

Box 6. Ko Omapere te wai, Aotearoa (New Zealand) 

The largest lake in Northland, Omapere (1197 ha), once a wetland forest, is shallow (2.6 m) and 
feeds the Utakura River that ows west to the Hokianga Harbour. Omapere is a taonga (treasure) 
to Ngapuhi, who maintain manawhenua (ownership) and kaitiaki (guardianship) rights and 
responsibilities through indigenous leadership. Ngapuhi have fought for the protection of Omapere, 
articulating the signi cance of its ecological integrity: use of the lake is determined by the health of the 
lake; the health of the lake and the health of the people are intertwined (Henwood and Henwood 2011).

Omapere was a “food basket” that supplied tuna (eel), torewai (freshwater mussels) and other 
resources, including raupo (bulrush), kapangawha (clubrush) and harakeke ( ax).

Clearing of native vegetation and dairy farming in the surrounding catchment led to dense growths 
of invasive oxygen weed (Tanner et al. 1986) that eventually collapsed, leaving Omapere turbid and 
algae dominated (Champion and Burns 2001). In 1985, the Northland Area Health Board advised the 
municipality to abandon its water for domestic supply due to a severe cyanobacterial bloom that 
polluted the Utakura River and upper reaches of the Hokianga, leaving traditional sh and shell sh 
stocks unsafe to eat (Grey 2012).

In 2004, tribal leadership brought together community stakeholders and responsible agencies to 
identify restoration and management strategies, implement monitoring and shing regulations, and 
commission studies. The ma uta ki tai (catchmentwide) process adopted emphasized the physical 
and social interconnectedness of waterways and human activities, and recommended integrated 
solutions. Community-led fencing of the lake edges, riparian planting and a local species nursery 
plus farm environmental plans reduced fertilizer run-o  and dissolved nitrogen and phosphate levels 
(Grey 2012).

There have been no algal blooms in the lake since 2007 and recent improvements in water quality 
have been linked to increased water- ltering torewai populations (Grey 2012). Many customary 
community practices of water use in the catchment have resumed and in 2011 tuna returned to the 
tables of Mokonui-a-rangi Marae, welcoming guests with this traditional kai (food) for the rst time in 
more than a decade.

Box 7. Biodiversity, physical health and community well-being

The “Feel Blue, Touch Green” project (Townsend & Ebden 2006) in 2005 engaged people 
experiencing depression and/or anxiety in hands-on conservation activities in partnership with 
ANGAIR (the Anglesea and Airey s Inlet Society for Protection of Flora and Fauna). Participants 
committed to 10 hours of conservation activities over 5–8 weeks, and the project and its impacts 
were evaluated using mood scales and in-depth interviews. The results showed that participants 
experienced positive emotional changes, with the most positive changes being an improved sense 
of relaxation, higher levels of interest and greater life satisfaction. Participants also scored highly 
in terms of improved health and happiness. These ndings were corroborated through interviews 
in which participants identi ed the importance of the context for and the focus of the activities 
(particularly the emphasis on biodiversity maintenance) in fostering the bene ts they were gaining 
and in transforming their interactions with the natural environment and with other people.

Those “bridging” bene ts were echoed in a study in 2007 (O Brien et al. 2008); using similar 
evaluation methods, motivations, barriers and bene ts of environmental volunteering in southern 
Scotland and northern England were explored. The groups studied ranged from local groups working 
with councils or NGOs to restore degraded local environments through to a group of volunteers who 
had raised £350 000 to purchase a valley in Scotland and were working to return it to the “wildwood” 
it would have been 6000 years ago! Volunteers typically experienced positive emotional changes 
on all parameters except pain, and even that was interpreted positively as indicating that they had 
worked hard, thus contributing to satisfaction!

Face-to-face interviews with volunteers and representatives of the organizations hosting the 
activities con rmed the individual, community and ecosystem well-being bene ts, many of which 
can be characterized using this notion of “bridging”.

However, the most telling example of this bridging across the divides came on the day when four 
diverse groups came together at Eskdale in the Lake District to do some coppicing (removal of 
invasive species to allow room for the native vegetation to grow). The volunteers included four 
persons from “Friends of the Lake District”, 10 “Environment Agency” sta  members (i.e. corporate 
volunteers), two Lake District National Park volunteers, and two sta  and three residents of West

The high biodiversity ecosystems within the Paci c are the settings for health where cultural 
identity, subsistence life and social systems exist (sensu Horwitz and Finlayson 2011). In a set of 
studies from the small-island developing state of Fiji, enkins et al. (2010) demonstrated the notable 
absence from degraded river basins of suites of sh that traditionally formed the staple diets of 
inland communities. Notably absent species in heavily modi ed catchments include many migratory 
species that form important commercial and cultural sheries for Paci c islanders. These e ects 
are largely seasonal and magni ed in degraded catchments, with pronounced negative impacts 
on food-provisioning services and biodiversity during heavy rainfall and severe storms ( enkins & 
upiter 2011). These e ects will likely become more severe under predicted future climate scenarios. 

Community bans on harvesting and clearing within riparian wetlands can be e ective in maintaining 
sh diversity, even in areas where forests have previously been extensively cleared ( enkins et 

al. 2010). However, these bene ts are rapidly lost once the ban is lifted and sh from rivers again 
become scarce ( enkins & upiter 2011). Fresh sh often contributes more than 75% of the sh 
consumption of both rural and urban areas of the Paci c, with the remainder comprising canned 

sh (Bell et. al 2009). Given the high levels of sh consumption, and the limited opportunities for 
agriculture and animal husbandry in small islands, sh usually contributes the majority of animal 
protein in the diet at the national level (Bell et al. 2009). For many Fijian inland communities, 
freshwater sh not only comprise a major part of the diet but also have important cultural totemic 
values. Loss of freshwater sh biodiversity therefore has important implications for physical and 
cultural well-being. Some authors note an ecology-driven model of well-being in many Paci c islands 
that is based on the vitality and abundance of natural resources relied upon for subsistence and 
cultural practices (McGregor et al. 2003). Within this ecological model, the collective family unit 
forms the core social unit within which the individual lives and interacts, which is interdependent 
upon the lands and associated resources for health (physical, mental and emotional) and social 
well-being. This case illustrates the potential for physical and psychosocial health to be e ected 
through loss in sh biodiversity. However, like many studies, while biodiversity loss can be clearly 
demonstrated, the precise nature of impact on physical health through nutritional or cultural de cit 
has not been investigated.

Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions³ resulting Haines et al. 2006).

¹ The Fifth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD highlighted the risks of climate change, in particular, to coral reefs 
(decision V/3) and to forest ecosystems (decision V/4), and drew attention to the serious impacts of biodiversity loss on 
these systems and their associated livelihoods. The cross-cutting issue on biodiversity and climate change was included in 
the work under the Convention in 2004 through decision VII/15 of the COP. Among other subsequent COP decisions on 
climate change, at its tenth meeting the COP in decision X/20 para 17b requested the executive Secretary to explore avenues 
for bridging the gaps between work being carried out to address the impacts of climate change on public health and work 
to address the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

³ Based on the most recent IPCC estimates, the greatest contributors of greenhouse gases are: CO2 (76%); CH4 (about 16%), 

N2O (about 6%) and the combined F-gases contribute about 2% (IPCC 2014a).
⁴ From 2000 to 2010, GHG emissions grew on average 2.2% per year compared to 1.3% per year over the entire period from

global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion has continued with emissions increasing by about 3% between 2010 and 
2011 and by about 1–2% between 2011 and 2012” (IPCC 2014b). By sector, the largest sources of GHG emissions came 
from energy production, agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU), and industry (IPCC 2014a).

Box 1. Direct, indirect and tertiary impacts of climate change on human health

Direct

Direct health impacts are those that are directly, causally attributable to climate change and/or 
climate variability, such as cardiovascular risk associated with heat waves, or risk of injury associated 
with more intense and frequent storms. The recent ndings of Working Group III of the IPCC have 
indicated, with a high degree of con dence, that the impacts of recent climate-related extremes, 
including heat waves, droughts, oods, cyclones and wild res, have already led to vulnerability 
and exposure of some ecosystems and several human systems to current climate variability. Such 
extreme weather events impact vulnerable groups such as the poor and elderly the most, though the 
adverse e ects on human health can be ameliorated to a certain extent by social and technological 
mediators, such as improved urban design and building standards (e.g. Santamouris 2013; Brown and 
Southworth 2004; Birkman et al. 2010).

Despite scienti c argument over whether the witnessed increase in heat waves, res and adverse 
crop yields in Eurasia in 2010 were random or had been exacerbated by anthropogenic climate 
change, the event still directly contributed to 50 000 excess deaths (Barriopedro et al. 2011). The 
subsequent rise in global grain prices further indirectly impacted human health and food security 
among vulnerable populations worldwide ( ohnstone and Mazo 2011). As such, the e ects of climate 
change on water, food security and extreme climatic events are likely to have profound direct impacts 
on global public health (Costello et al. 2009). Heat-wave induced mortality of food source species, 
ecological keystone species, and disease vectors and reservoirs are other examples of primary e ects.

Indirect

Indirect health impacts arise as downstream e ects of climate change and variability. These impacts 
are broad and variable in their etiology, such as change in infectious disease vector distribution and 
air pollution interacting with heat waves.

The changing ecology of disease-bearing vectors was raised by Leaf in 1989, though the health impacts 
of climate change on vector-borne diseases has been contested by some ecologists (e.g. La erty 
2009) and experts from within the disease community (e.g. Gething et al. 2010; Randolph 2009). The 
debate is nally showing signs of abatement for some of the most prevalent vector-borne diseases, 
including malaria. Consensus is emerging that, indeed, climate change does magnify such risks (Siraj et 

⁷  Several plausible reasons have been put forth to explain their lack of prominence – the most likely being the interdisciplinary 
nature of these issues in the context of a scientific community that is still poorly equipped to equitably hear, consolidate 
and incorporate numerous competing interests, including those of social scientists (Castree et al. 2014; Heller and Zavaleta 
2009). Thus, recent scientific culture has been reluctant to venture beyond a fairly narrow band of thinking, effectively 
tabooing integrative cross-sectoral analysis and written reflection on challenges such as differences in economic, political, 
cultural and other forms of power, population growth, the “right” to unbridled consumption and limits to growth and 
corresponding impacts on health, biodiversity and life-sustaining ecosystem services. 

224 Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health



al. 2014), though advances in technology, prevention and treatment can combine to reduce the burden 
of diseases like malaria (Feachem et al. 2010). Climate change directly contributes to damage of both 
infrastructure and human settlements, resulting in human mortality and morbidity that includes the 
mental health and well-being of survivors (IPCC 2014d). In countries at all stages of development, these 
impacts are consistent with a lack of preparedness for climatic variability in some sectors; the most 
salient manifestations will be among the poorest and most vulnerable populations (IPCC, 2014d).

Tertiary

The third – “tertiary impacts” – category is, by a number of magnitudes, the most important health 
risk associated with climate change (Butler 2014b). These include the health impacts of large-scale 
famine, forced migration and human con ict, which result from the geophysical and ecological 
consequences of climate change, including the alteration of ecosystems, sea-level rise, and long-
term disruptions in water supply and food production. Surprisingly, with rare exceptions, this group 
of e ects has been little mentioned in the intervening decades, including in the most recent IPCC 
reports released in 2014.  These must be considered more holistically as we prepare to embark upon 
new global commitments on climate change and a post-2015 Development Agenda.

increases of up to 1000 times that of historical background rates (MA 2005).

¹⁰ For example, Lambin et al. (2001) suggest that land-use change is driven by both proximate causes (which are local and 
direct, and explain how and why anthropogenic activity acts on land cover and on ecosystem processes at a local scale), and 
underlying causes (indirect or root causes based on regional and sometimes global policies, economic forces and technological 
advancement that interact with and mediate the relationship at the local scale). The complex interactions between proximate 
and underlying causes interact over time (in a limited number of ways) to drive land management decisions and practices.

relationships (Luis et al. 2013) but the impact of climate is likely to be an additional factor in their 
emergence and continued transmission, as these species are capable of ying long distances to 
optimize resources and nd alternative roosts. Widespread bush res in Sumatra were suspected of 
in uencing fruit bat–pathogen dynamics prior to the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 
(Chua 2003). While epidemic enhancement and agricultural intensi cation are co-factors (Pulliam et 
al. 2012), it remains possible that the res and other climatic stress factors on food resources have 
in uenced viral loads and spillover (Daszak et al. 2013).

More speculatively, climate change, together with deforestation and other land-use changes, has 
been hypothesized as a contributing factor in the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa (see 
also the chapter on infectious diseases in this volume). It is di cult to isolate climate as a driver in 
the context of extensive deforestation and profound economic and public health failures, further 
undermined by years of civil con ict (Bausch and Schwarz 2014). However, prolonged depression 
of primary forest production during lengthy droughts in central Africa followed by sudden rainfall 
events appears to enhance the opportunity for Ebola transmission between bats and other wildlife 
that concentrate on available resources (Tucker et al. 2002).

During the Australian summer of 2014, an estimated 100 000 fruit bats fell dead in the streets 
of Brisbane and south-eastern Queensland towns. (The number that died outside urban areas is 
unknown.) The bats are highly temperature sensitive (Welbergen et al. 2008) and it is unlikely they 
could survive a heat wave with temperatures above 43°C. Removing corpses was a major exercise 
for the urban authorities, and gloves and collection bins were supplied to residents. At least 16 
people were treated for possible Australian bat lyssavirus (related to rabies and fatal without 
immunoglobulins) after they were scratched or bitten by dying bats. It is yet to be understood 
what e ect the deaths will have on the bat colonies themselves. The 2011 spike and dispersed 
distribution of another zoonotic (transmissible to humans) Australian bat-borne disease, Hendra 
virus, is believed to be a consequence of the dispersal of bats after widespread ooding in south-
east Queensland following Cyclone asi in 2010. The higher latitude range extension of two host 
species of this disease, and increased urbanization of all four, in preceding decades are suspected 
factors in disease emergence (Plowright et al. 2011).

Box 3. Climate change and ecosystem-based adaptation in the Hindu Kush Himalayas

The Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH), otherwise referred to as the greater Himalayan region, extend 
from eastern Nepal and Bhutan to northern Afghanistan, and have among the most extensive areas 
covered by glaciers and permafrost on the planet. They contain water resources that drain through 
ten of the largest rivers in Asia,  from which over 1.3 million people derive their livelihoods and 
upon which many more depend for water and other resources (Eriksson et al. 2009). The region has 
been recognized as a uniquely biodiversity-rich area with equally unique topographic characteristics 
and socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The accelerated rate of warming,  glacier ice 
melt and related implications on the hydrological systems of central, south and east Asia are among 
the most widely cited (Armstrong 2010; Eriksson et al. 2009). The retreating of glaciers (in this region 
and elsewhere) is a sentinel indicator of climate change but also one of the most di cult to quantify, 
given the physical and spatial complexity of glaciers and data collection.

Ongoing challenges in regions in which large proportions of the population live in mountain 
communities, such as Bhutan and Nepal, include poverty, poor medical support, less access to 
education and shorter life expectancies. While climate change may bring some bene ts to mountain 

¹⁶ In the greater Himalaya region, it is estimated that snow and glacial melting contribute approximately 50% of annual river 
flows (Eriksson et al. 2009).

¹⁷ Here, the term Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) sometimes referred to as greater Himalayan region, includes the Himalayan, 
Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges, where there is currently glacier coverage. The HKH, 
however, does not constitute one single region, as the eastern Himalayas are separated from the Karakoram–Hindu Kush 
mountains by approximately 2000 km, though there is no sharp separation between east and west. Differences in climate 
and in glacier behaviour and dynamics have been reported across the area, with variations in these conditions throughout 
(Armstrong 2010).

¹⁸ These are the Amu Darya, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Irrawaddy, Mekong, Salween, Tarim, Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.
¹⁹ It has been estimated that global warming in the region has been 0.6 ºC per decade versus 0.74 ºC per hundred years as a 

global average (Eriksson et al. 2009).
²⁰ Several glaciers in the extended HKH region are retreating but the extent of the impact of climate change on glacier ice is not 

well known as glacier data in the Himalayas and surrounding mountains are very sparse and conditions vary significantly 
along the south–east to north–west transect of the Himalayan–Karakoram–Hindu Kush mountain ranges (Armstrong 2010).

Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health 233



regions (e.g. longer growing seasons), mountain dwellers and lowland communities also face a 
broad and unique range of climate-related health risks. These include water and food shortages, 
increased risk of natural disasters and the expansion of water-related and vector-borne diseases 
(Ebi et al. 2007; Ahmed and Suphachalasai 2014).  Increased variability in precipitation patterns 
(including variability in monsoon and more frequent extreme rainfall), coupled with increased risk 
of extreme weather events and glacial ice melt are predicted to increase the risk of oods (carrying 
rock, sediments and debris), landslides, threats to forest ecoregions including increased forest res 
in some areas, soil erosion, and habitat and ecosystem disruption,  damage to infrastructure and 
property, injury and loss of human life (Ahmed and Suphachalasai 2014; Armstrong 2010; Ebi et 
al. 2007). Of particular concern in the region are the potentially devastating impacts on mountain 
dwellers and lowland communities from glacial lake outburst oods, which have become more 
frequent since the latter half of the twentieth century (WHO 2005; Armstrong 2010).

Addressing the threats posed or compounded by climate change demands the development of 
integrated and holistic approaches for the management of mountain ecosystems that sustain the 

ow of life-supporting services. This can be achieved with innovative adaptation solutions (including 
ecosystem-based adaptation), such as sustaining highland wetland systems that provide water 
regulation, other services and habitats for critical animal and plant species (including medicinal 
plants), or new technologies such as drip irrigation systems (CBD 2012; Chettri 2011).

Ecosystem-based adaptation in fragile mountain ecosystems such as HKH can not only provide 
co-bene ts at the global or national level but may also be integrated into regional policies to 
jointly encourage climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, and 
development at a landscape level (Sharma et al. 2010). In the HKH, holistic ecosystem-based 
adaptation strategies that emphasize adaptation as an interdisciplinary issue have been advocated. 
These interventions seek to achieve the sustainable management of the transboundary reserve 
system through the application of landscape-based solutions to jointly reduce the vulnerabilities 
of biodiversity and local communities to climate change and other drivers by restoring endemic 
vegetation, developing connectivity between ecosystems, and monitoring large-scale changes to 
increase the social and economic resilience of local populations (Chattra et al. 2009).

Case study: The use of vegetation in slope stabilization

In China, arti cial, human-made structures have traditionally been employed to protect communities 
and infrastructure from shallow landslides, but these have short lifespans and have in many instances 
caused considerable disruption to ecosystems. Ecological engineering involves “the design of 
sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the bene t of 
both” (Stokes et al. 2014). The use of plants as ecological engineers represents a more cost–e ective 
and enduring option to combine with civil engineering approaches, with the potential of being self-
sustaining, increasing in e cacy over time, enhancing local biodiversity, and providing a plethora of 
ecosystem services that can help address various drivers of livelihood vulnerability.

Several studies have shown that the establishment of certain types of vegetation cover signi cantly 
reduces shallow landslides and erosion on steep slopes (>35°) due to the ability of root systems 
to modify the biophysical, mechanical and hydrological properties of soil (Stokes et al. 2010; 
Reubens et al. 2007; Fattet et al. 2011; Ghestem et al. 2011; Mao et al. 2014). To be e ective, 
however, ecological engineering techniques require that the mechanical, chemical and architectural 
traits of plant root systems be determined on a site-speci c basis to determine optimum species 
combinations and planting con gurations for rehabilitating, protecting and stabilizing degraded 
slopes (Stokes et al. 2014).

Certain species are traditionally favoured in slope stabilization – such as vetiver grass in China (Ke 
et al. 2003), but monocultures can be a high-risk venture, thus favouring a mixture of di erent plant 
functional types for slope stabilization, for example (Stokes et al., 2014; Fattet et al., 2011; Pohl et 
al. 2009; Reubens et al. 2007). Polyculture plantations provide a range of root systems for optimum 
soil stability. They also foster a heterogeneous environment for enhanced biodiversity and overall 
ecosystem functioning, as well as supporting opportunities for income generation and a number of 
other socioeconomic co-bene ts (Gouzerh et al. 2013; Shi and Li 1999; Post and Kwon 2000; Cavaillé 
et al. 2013).

While ecological engineering usually does not incorporate, but can enhance the e ciency of, human-
made structures, another key distinction between these approaches relates to their e ectiveness 
over time and space. From the rst moment of hard engineering installation, no erosion should occur; 
however, this ecological engineering relies largely on plant growth, leaving a window of susceptibility 
during the early years of restoration of a site when plants are too small to fully contribute to soil 
stability (Stokes et al. 2004; 2008).

Case study: Building coastal resilience – bamboo wave barriers in Thailand

I nd the sea level becoming higher and higher each year. Storms are more frequent and unpredictable. 
If the situation continues, we may have nowhere to live.” — Kanit Sookdang

An innovative mangrove restoration project in southern Thailand has used ecological engineering to 
mitigate the impacts of coastal storms and erosion. Klong Prasong is a shing village located on Klang 
Island in the Krabi river estuary along Thailand s Andaman sea coast. For many years, powerful waves, 
strong winds and rising sea levels threatened the village and its inhabitants, eroding the shoreline, 
damaging infrastructure and properties, and forcing villagers to relocate to higher land. Local 

shermen report that waves have eroded the coastal area by more than 1 km and Kanit Sookdang, a 
54-year-old villager from Klong Prasong, has been forced to move house ve times in the past three 
decades due to coastal erosion (Sarnsamak 2014; BP 2014).

Representing socionatural disasters, the storms and coastal erosion experienced in Klong Prasong 
can be attributed to a complex interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors, including the monsoon 
climate, intensive shrimp cultivation and the e ects of climate change. This multifaceted risk 
pro le is further complicated by the increasing frequency and severity of coastal erosion and storm 
conditions over the past few years, an intensi cation which demonstrates the dynamic nature of 
disaster events over time and calls for a new approach to disaster management on Klang Island.

Observing the ine ectiveness of a concrete barrier wall constructed in 2003 – which, despite being 
raised in height, failed to protect communities and actually augmented sediment loss and the e ects 
of coastal ooding – a community-initiated demonstration project under Raks Thai Foundation s 
“Building Coastal Resilience to Reduce Climate Change Impacts in Thailand and Indonesia (BCRCC)” 
initiative adopted a true EbA. It constructed a bamboo wave barrier in an attempt to address coastal 
erosion and facilitate the re-establishment of mangrove forests (Enright and Nakornchai 2014; Raks 
Thai 2014).

It is anticipated that the bamboo wall will reduce wave energy, mitigate erosion and foster the 
accumulation of sediment on its landward side in which mangroves can be planted. The structure – 
made from bamboo sourced locally in Krabi province – is expected to last approximately seven 
years, su cient time to enable mangroves to form a natural bioshield. The dense network of trunks, 
branches and aerial roots of mangroves help shelter coastlines from strong winds and generate 
a high drag force, which attenuates waves and dissipates their energy across the intertidal zone 
(McIvor et al. 2012; Alongi 2008; Feagin et al. 2010; Giri et al. 2008). Mangroves have, in a number of 
instances, been observed to signi cantly reduce the impacts of storm events on coastal communities, 
reducing economic damages, mitigating biodiversity losses and saving lives (Das and Crépin 2013; 
Quartel et al. 2007; Kathiresan and Rajendran 2005; Badola and Hussain 2005).

244 Connecting Global Priorities: Biodiversity and Human Health



While community members and visitors in Klong Prasong will be directly involved in the planting 
process – planting locally raised seedlings helps to build stewardship, awareness and support for 
the project – the bamboo barrier will also facilitate natural regeneration, trapping oating mangrove 
propagules to yield a forest with a high level of biodiversity. It is widely accepted that multispecies 
systems have greater ecological resilience than monospeci c forest stands, and are thus more capable 
of mitigating natural disasters. Heterogeneous forests also provide a greater range of opportunities 
for livelihood diversi cation, demonstrating that ecological restoration, DRR and socioeconomic 
development are mutually reinforcing (MAP 2012; ayakody et al. 2012; Vickers et al. 2012).

In addition to enhancing the resilience of coastal communities to disasters, mangrove forests 
generate other bene ts by ltering water, absorbing CO2 and providing a breeding habitat for aquatic 
animals (Enright and Kaewmahanin 2012; Sudtongkong and Webb 2008; Barraclough and Finger-
Stich 1996). Accordingly, it is hoped that the re-establishment of mangrove forests along the coast 
of Klong Prasong will restore local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning for livelihood support, 
improved local food security and enhanced community health and well-being.

Although budget restrictions meant that only a single-layer bamboo barrier was constructed under 
the BCRCC project, the demonstration of this innovative approach to disaster management convinced 
the Krabi Provincial Administrative O ce to build a more substantial, 500 m long double-layer 
bamboo barrier, supported with government investments of 1 750 000 Baht (US  55 000). This 
illustrates a new commitment by the government to ecosystem-based DRR approaches (Enright and 
Nakornchai 2014).

While it is too early to evaluate the long-term impacts of these bamboo wave barriers, a number 
of successes have already become apparent. Only eight months after the bamboo was rst put in 
place – in une 2013 – assessments found that 15 cm of sediment had accumulated behind the 
structure, with a clearly visible di erence in soil strata height between the seaward and landward 
sides. Planted Avicennia marina seedlings had a survival rate of 80–90%, compared with rates of 
just 10% when the same species was planted in front of the concrete wall. Signi cant increases 
have also been recorded in the biodiversity and population sizes of aquatic species, particularly 
molluscs: Musculus senhousia, Donex scortum and Meretrix sp. Local people can now expect to collect 
at least 3 kg of Donex scortum each during every collection session – a few hours during the low tide 
when the mud ats are exposed – which they had been unable to do in the recent past (Enright and 
Nakornchai 2014).

This innovative approach to disaster resilience has also had a positive impact on the mental health 
and well-being of community members in Klong Prasong. Village residents reported that they used 
to sleep uneasily with the sound of strong waves hitting the concrete wall and a constant fear that 
seawater would ood their homes. The construction of the bamboo barrier has increased their sense 
of security and allows them to sleep peacefully in the knowledge that they are better protected.

Case study: Rwandan refugees in Gihembe National Park

In Rwanda s Gihembe camp, agricultural activities have fostered economic self-reliance for refugees 
who cultivate mushrooms to enrich their diets and generate income. With support from the American 
Refugee Committee (ARC), an association of 50 women living with HIV/AIDS has been established and 
supported to pursue commercial agriculture. The women have received extensive training on a range 
of topics – including association ethics, marketing, basic accountancy and business development 
– and encouraged to employ sustainable land management techniques for the conservation of 
ecological resources, minimizing soil and water erosion through terrace construction, trench digging 
and the planting of 780 agro-forestry trees (ARC 2014).

In seven months, 3700 kg of mushrooms have been harvested, with 3000 kg sold to camp residents, 
host community members and a local mushroom farm company (at around 1000 Rwandan francs 
US  2  per kg) and the remaining 700 kg divided between the members of the association for 

domestic consumption (Gonzalez 2006).

In addition to providing nutritional bene ts, this project has encouraged money management and a 
culture of saving has begun to develop among the women. The association account contains over 1.5 
million Rwandan francs (US  2200), a third of which is shared as pro t among members and stored in 

xed deposit accounts to accrue interest (ARC 2014). This resource-based income-generating project 
has also contributed to ghting the stigma surrounding HIV in the camp. Refugees and members of 
the host community who purchase the mushrooms have been made aware that those living with this 
disease are still able to work productively and contribute to life in Gihembe, reducing prejudice and 
enhancing the quality of life for all those with HIV (ARC 2014).

The agricultural activities in Gihembe refugee camp demonstrate that well-managed ecosystems 
are capable of providing a direct source of livelihoods for displaced populations. With active 
participation and capacity building, the refugees were able to help themselves, utilizing locally

ordanian households use an estimated 80 L of water per day on average, but communities in which 
refugee camps have been established have seen the average supply drop below 30 L per day, with 
accompanying declines in sanitation and a rise in disease incidence. As the quality and quantity of 
limited water reserves continues to deteriorate, attention has turned towards demand and the poor 
water conservation habits of Syrians, who are unaccustomed to living in a water-scarce environment 
and are thus prone to wasting water.

Future e orts at water management must be implemented with long-term sustainability in mind in 
order to preserve natural resources, support their restoration and maximize public health bene ts. 
A holistic approach incorporating water demand management could also include the promotion of 
simple and culturally appropriate conservation practices at the household level in order to reduce 
water consumption and facilitate the possibility of groundwater replenishment.

Box 1: Global Biodiversity Outlook-4: A mid term assessment of progress towards 
the Aichi Biodiversity Targets

In 2014, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity assessed progress 
in the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets. (See Chapter I, box 1, on the basis of an evaluation contained in the fourth edition of the 
Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-4; see also Tittensor et al 2014). The assessment shows that 
signi cant progress towards meeting the components of the majority of the Aichi targets. However, 
in most cases, this progress will not be su cient to achieve the targets set for 2020 and additional 
action is required. The evaluation was based on multiple lines of evidence including global 
assessments extrapolated trends in 55 indicators to 2020 and 2050, including response indicators 
and indicators based on projections on the state of biodiversity. The conclusions are that while 
responses to biodiversity loss are increasing (i.e countries are taking action), the large majority 
of projections of the state of biodiversity to 2020 and 2050 show a signi cant deterioration and 
pressures on biodiversity continue to increase.

The Outlook also identi es actions that would help to accelerate progress and concludes that 
attaining most of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will require implementation of a package of 
actions typically including: legal and policy frameworks; socioeconomic incentives aligned to such 
frameworks; public and stakeholder engagement; monitoring and enforcement. Coherence of policies 
across sectors and the corresponding government ministries is necessary to deliver an e ective 
package of actions.

Box 1: Workshops on the interlinkages between biodiversity and human health

In 2012, the WHO and the CBD embarked on an unprecedented joint collaborative endeavour aimed 
at engaging the health and biodiversity sectors worldwide, with a particular focus on developing 
countries, where concerted action is most urgently needed, in order to build capacity, and promote 
action to jointly protect biodiversity and promote human health in the context of sustainable 
development. The initial series of regional capacity-building workshops jointly convened by these 
organizations, in collaboration with national and regional country partners, were held for the Americas 
in Manaus, Brazil in September 2012 and for Africa in Maputo, Mozambique in April 2013. Country 
representatives from the biodiversity and health sectors from a combined total of some 50 countries, 
and a number of relevant organizations, regional experts and representatives of indigenous and local 
communities, gathered to survey some of the critical linkages at the biodiversity-health nexus and 
their relevance to the Strategic Plan and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets and to discuss the need to further 
mainstream biodiversity in public health strategies and to incorporate public health considerations in 
biodiversity strategies. Participants agreed upon an initial broad set of conclusions which have been 
further revised and adapted in light of the issues identi ed throughout various chapters of this state of 
knowledge review, in the broader context of the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 
2011–2020 and the Post-2015 development agenda. These conclusions are re ected in sections 2 
and 3 of this chapter as a broad framework for the integration of the biodiversity-health considerations 
in local, national and regional strategies (see also Romanelli et al. 2014b) .

Box 1: The TEEB approach

Recognizing Value: Recognizing value in ecosystems, landscapes, species and other aspects of 
biodiversity is a feature of all human societies, and is sometimes su cient to ensure conservation 
and sustainable use. This may be the case especially where the spiritual or cultural values of nature 
are strong. For example, protected areas such as national parks have historically been established 
in response to a sense of collective heritage or patrimony, a perception of shared cultural or social 
value being placed on treasured landscapes, charismatic species or natural wonders. Protective 
legislation or voluntary agreements can be appropriate responses where biodiversity values are 
generally recognized and accepted. In such circumstances, monetary valuation of biodiversity and 
ecosystem services may be unnecessary, or even counterproductive if it is seen as contrary to 
cultural norms or fails to re ect a plurality of values.

Demonstrating Value: Demonstrating value in economic terms is sometimes useful for policymakers 
and others, in reaching decisions that consider the full costs and bene ts of a proposed use of 
an ecosystem, rather than only costs or values that enter markets in the form of private goods. 
Economic valuations of natural areas are a case in point. Examples include calculating the costs and 
bene ts of conserving the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in treating human wastes and 
controlling oods, compared to the cost of providing the same services by building water treatment 
facilities or concrete ood defences. Valuation is best applied for assessing the consequences of 
changes resulting from alternative management options, rather than attempting to estimate the 
total value of ecosystems. Most valuation studies do not assess the full range of ecosystem services 
and not all biodiversity values can be reliably estimated using existing methods. The identi cation 
of all signi cant changes in ecosystem services is a necessary rst step even if all of them are not 
monetized.

Capturing Value: This nal tier involves the introduction of mechanisms that incorporate the values 
of ecosystems into decision-making, through incentives and price signals. This can include payments 
for ecosystem services, reforming environmentally harmful subsidies, introducing tax breaks for 
conservation, or creating new markets for sustainably produced goods and ecosystem services. It 
needs to come along with reinforcing rights over natural resources and liability for environmental 
damage. The challenge for decision makers is to assess when market-based solutions to biodiversity 
loss are likely to be culturally acceptable, as well as e ective, e cient and equitable.
